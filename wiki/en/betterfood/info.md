A very small and simple as can be plugin that automatically makes players eat cooked and crafted food from their inventories.

The list of valid items is as follows:
- Dried kelp
- Cookies
- Melon slices
- Sweet berries
- Apples
- Baked potatoes
- Bread
- Cooked cod
- Cooked rabbit
- Beetroot soup
- Cooked chicken
- Cooked mutton
- Cooked salmon
- Mushroom stew
- Cooked porkchop
- Pumpkin pie
- Cooked beef
- Rabbit stew

# Why?

Honestly I never liked how Mojang implemented the food system. It constantly takes players out of what they're doing in order to fill up a meaningless bar. I do understand that food is important for a survival game, but I think holding down right click for a few seconds every couple of minutes does not make for a compelling game mechanic.





What about other foods?
Raw foods and foods that give buffs are best left to manage by the player. I would not want players to waste raw food they're harvesting for cooking, nor am I making this plugin to make people lazier about food. If people are willing to put the effort in to cook or craft their food, they get to have it refill automatically. Sounds like a good balance, right?
