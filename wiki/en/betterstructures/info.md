Welcome to the BetterStructures wiki!

This is Spigot Minecraft plugin aimed towards creating a generator-agnostic topology scanner capable of finding high compatibility spots based on geometry and block characteristics complimented with non-intrusive terrain adaptation methods.

Basically, it takes schematics, does a bunch of measurements and pastes them, often times adding pedestals and using special blocks to make sure the pastes look really good.

Read through the wiki to get an idea of what you can do for the plugin, or what it can do for you!
