# What is BetterStructures?

BetterStructures is a plugin which aims to fit custom pre-made structures in any world generation. These builds can be downloaded, edited and created by anyone. Premade structures are provided in [https://magmaguy.itch.io/](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) and [https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy). At the time of writing this there is a pack of 103 free builds you can download from itch right now, on top of premium ones.

These builds can be put in the air, on liquids (regular oceans and lava oceans), fit on terrain surfaces and placed underground. BetterStructures divides the underground into two sections - shallow underground and deep underground. It also works for any generator - normal, end and nether, and most "normal" minecraft world generators (skygrid is the only known exception).

## Plugin requirements

### WorldEdit / FAWE

BetterStructures relies on WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit (pick one) to past the schematics into your worlds.

If you download WorldEdit make sure you download the correct version for your server - if things aren't pasting correctly odds are you have the wrong version of WorldEdit on!

Additionally, EliteMobs is a recommended plugin and necessary if you wish to use the elite packs. Using it means being able to get structures that have whole custom boss fights in them!

Those using the elite packs should also use WorldGuard, as it will protect the combat areas the bosses are in until the bosses are defeated, after which point players will be able to mine that location.

## Installing pre-made content

Installing pre-made content is the fastest and easiest way of getting started with BetterStructures, and for most servers it is all you will want to do.

Due to the size of schematic files, BetterStructures does not come with builds pre-packaged. However, default builds are distributed for free on [https://magmaguy.itch.io/](https://magmaguy.itch.io/).

You can also use other existing schematics (you may want to customize them a bit, more on that in the advanced section) or download unofficial packages - or even make your own!

[You can watch this video for an installation guide for the plugin!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/time-for-some-77982443)

The steps to install the content are quite simple:

1) Download the files from [patreon.com/magmaguy](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy) or [magmaguy.itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/)

2) Put the zipped files in the imports folder of BetterStructures ( ~/plugins/BetterStructures/imports)

3) Run `/betterstructures reload` from in-game.

You're done!
