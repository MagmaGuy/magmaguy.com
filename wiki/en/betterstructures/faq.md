# How to Use Commands
- Go to the commands page for help: [Commands Page]($language$/betterstructures/commands.md)

# Checking Where Structures Appear
- If you are a server admin and haven't turned off warnings, you'll be notified in chat when a structure appears.
- Click the chat message to teleport to the structure (not for Bedrock edition).
- Turn warnings on/off with `/betterstructures warn`.

# Why Structures May Not Appear
- Usually, structures don't appear in areas already explored. Visit new areas for structures.

<summary>More Details</summary>

Structures won't appear in already explored areas to avoid filling them too much and damaging player buildings. BetterStructures knows if an area was explored before it was installed and wonâ€™t place structures there. If your world was fully explored before installing BetterStructures, you need to regenerate it or create a new world.

# EliteMobs and BetterStructures

## What EliteMobs Offers
- Learn about EliteMobs: [EliteMobs Wiki](#)
- It adds bosses to structures.

## Getting Pre-Made EliteMobs Content
- Available at [magmaguy.itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) and [patreon.com/magmaguy](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy)

## Using EliteMobs Without Other Features
- You can turn off other EliteMobs features. To disable, change settings in:
    - events.yml: `timedEventsEnabled: false` and `actionEventsEnabled: false` disables all events
    - MobCombatSettings.yml: `doNaturalMobSpawning: false` disables natural elite spawns

## Adding an EliteMobs boss to your structure

- Add `[elitemobs]` to the first line of your sign
- Add the filename of the boss on the second / third / fourth lines of the sign like `test_boss.yml`
- More info [here]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md)

# BetterStructures with other plugins

## MythicMobs
- Spawn mythic mobs using signs with `[mythicmobs]` followed by the mob identifier on the other lines of the sign.
- EliteMobs is better for bosses with BetterStructures because I made both.

## MMOItems
- Add MMOItems with `mmoitems=<TYPE>@<ITEM-ID>` in the treasure configuration file.

## Custom Items from Other Plugins
- Use the lootify command to add any items to chests. See [Commands Page]($language$/betterstructures/commands.md).

# Creating Your Own Structures
- Learn how: [Structure Creation Guide]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md)

# Performance Impact and Minimization
- Generating many structures can slow down your server.
- Use [Chunky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) to pre-generate your world and avoid performance issues.
- If not using EliteMobs, you can remove BetterStructures after world generation.
- With EliteMobs, keep BetterStructures for protected areas management, with minimal impact.
