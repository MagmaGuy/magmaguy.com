# Installing content

You are able to create your own content, so this step is not mandatory, but if you wish to install the hundreds of pre-made official BetterStructures builds you can follow these steps:

1) Go to [magmaguy.itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) or [patreon.com/magmaguy](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy)
2) Download the content you want
3) Put the content - still zipped, as you downloaded it - in the folder `~plugins/BetterStructures/imports`
4) Run the command `/bs reload`

You are done! Structure will now begin spawning in ***new chunks***. *Chunks your server has already generated will not be able to get structures!*
