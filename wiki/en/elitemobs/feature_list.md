# Feature List

EliteMobs has so many features it's easy to miss some of them. Here's a checklist to see if you know all of them!

- Elite Mobs can be procedurally generated
- Elite Mobs can be Custom Bosses, which have very deep customization options
- Custom Elite Mobs can be set to spawn and respawn consistently in one location (World Bosses)
- Custom Elite Mobs can be set to have different boss phases (Phase Bosses)
- Loot can be dynamic
- Loot can be custom
- Custom loot can use custom models
- Loot can be bound to one player, preventing other people from using it
- Loot can have continuous and on hit potion effects that apply to the player or to the target
- There are several custom EliteMobs enchantments
- All enchantments prefixed with "Elite" (like "Elite Protection") only apply when fighting against Elite Mobs
- There are treasure chests in Elite Mobs that can be locked based on guild progression and can turn out to be mimics (spawn a Custom Boss)
- You can use LibsDisguises to disguise a Custom Boss as anything else
- You can use Vault to connect the EliteMobs economy to the rest of your economy (not recommended)
- You can use WorldGuard to set where in the world Elite Mobs can spawn, can't spawn, where non-elites can and can't spawn, where the antiexploit system doesn't apply, set minimum and maximum levels for elites spawned there and set areas where EliteMobs events can't happen
- You can use PlaceholderAPI (PAPI) to connect various EliteMobs elements to things like chat, scoreboard and so on
- You can use DiscordSRV to post EliteMobs announcements on your discord server, like specific World Boss spawns or deaths
- Some bosses spawn based on player events, like mining
- Some bosses spawn based on server events, like a meteor crashing into the world
- EliteMobs has an NPC system which allows you to force players to trade only through NPCs instead of using commands
- **There are EliteMobs Lairs and Minidungeons you can download on discord for free and even more on Patreon**
- You can use the Adventurer's Guild world as a hub for EliteMobs NPCs, it sets itself up automatically if uploaded to your server (not a replacement for your overworld!)
- There are dynamic quests to kill Elites
- There is a per-world optional Nightmare mode which makes nights longer and increases Elite Mob spawns
- There is a per-world optional Region Leveling mode which makes Elite Mobs' level based on the zone they're standing in
- There is a guild system which players progress through to get better gear and rewards like increased max health and chance to dodge
- The guild system has a prestige system which allows players to unlock more ranks and better rewards in exchange for losing all of their EliteMobs progress so far
- Gear is limited by the guild rank by default, encouraging people to interact more with challenging mechanics
- There is an antiexploit system which prevents players from easily farming gear by exploiting terrain
- The trails around procedurally generated Elite Mobs indicates what powers they have
- Higher level Elites have more, stronger powers
- The higher your gear, the higher the level of the elite spawned, the higher the level of the gear it drops
- All player commands are centralized in the /em command, meaning players don't have to remember any commands other than that one
- Elite Mobs has Super Mobs, which stacks farm animals when 50 are in close proximity
- EliteMobs uses the permissionless mode by default, which requires no further setup from admins for the plugin to basically work (though the AG world and the dungeons are strongly recommended)
- EliteMobs was 100% developed by one guy. Send help. Preferably in the form of caffeine. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy) is fine too.
