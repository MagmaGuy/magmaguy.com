# Feature List

EliteMobs has so many features it's easy to miss some of them. Here's a checklist to see if you know all of them!

- Elite Mobs can be procedurally generated.
- Elite Mobs can be [Custom Bosses]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md), which have very deep customization options.
- Custom Elite Mobs can be set to spawn and respawn consistently in one location ([World Bosses]($language$/elitemobs/creating_world_bosses.md)).
- Custom Elite Mobs can be set to have different boss phases ([Boss Phases]($language$/elitemobs/creating_boss_phases.md)).
- Loot can be dynamic.
- Loot can be [custom]($language$/elitemobs/creating_items.md).
- Custom loot can use [custom models]($language$/elitemobs/creating_items.md&section=custommodelid&section=custommodelid).
- Loot can be [soulbound]($language$/elitemobs/soulbind.md) to one player, preventing other players from using it.
- Loot can have continuous and on hit [potion effects]($language$/elitemobs/creating_items.md&section=potioneffects) that apply to the player or to the target.
- There are several custom [EliteMobs Enchantments]($language$/elitemobs/custom_enchantments_list.md).
- All enchantments prefixed with "Elite" (like "Elite Protection") only apply when fighting against Elite Mobs.
- There are [treasure chests]($language$/elitemobs/creating_treasure_chests.md) in Elite Mobs that can be locked based on guild progression and can turn out to be mimics (spawn a Custom Boss).
- You can use [LibsDisguises]($language$/elitemobs/libsdisguises.md) to disguise a Custom Boss as anything else, including other players!
- You can use [Vault]($language$/elitemobs/vault.md) to connect the EliteMobs economy to the rest of your economy (not recommended).
- You can use [WorldGuard]($language$/elitemobs/worldguard_flags.md) to set where in the world Elite Mobs can spawn, can't spawn, where non-elites can and can't spawn, where the antiexploit system doesn't apply, set minimum and maximum levels for elites spawned there and set areas where EliteMobs events can't happen.
- You can use PlaceholderAPI ([PAPI]($language$/elitemobs/placeholders.md)) to connect various EliteMobs elements to things like chat, scoreboard and so on.
- You can use [DiscordSRV]($language$/elitemobs/discordsrv.md) to post EliteMobs announcements on your discord server, like specific World Boss spawns or deaths.
- Some bosses spawn based on player [events]($language$/elitemobs/elitemobs+creating_events.md&section=what-are-custom-events?), like mining.
- Some bosses spawn based on server [events]($language$/elitemobs/elitemobs+creating_events.md&section=what-are-custom-events?), like a meteor crashing into the world.
- EliteMobs has an NPC System ([Learn more here]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md)) which allows you to force players to trade only through NPCs instead of using commands.
- **There are [EliteMobs Lairs and Minidungeons]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md) you can download on discord for free and even more on Patreon**
- EliteMobs fully supports [Instanced Dungeons]($language$/elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md&section=instanced-dungeoneering), complete with full difficulty and class role support.
- You can use the [Adventurer's Guild]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md) world as a hub for EliteMobs NPCs, it sets itself up automatically if uploaded to your server (not a replacement for your overworld!).
- There are dynamic quests to kill Elites.
- There is a per-world optional [Nightmare mode]($language$/elitemobs/nightmare_mode.md) which makes nights longer and increases Elite Mob spawns.
- There is a per-world optional [Region Leveling]($language$/elitemobs/region_leveling_mode.md) mode which makes Elite Mobs' level based on the zone they're standing in.
- There is a [guild system]($language$/elitemobs/guild_tier_loot_limiter.md) which players progress through to get better gear and rewards like increased max health and chance to dodge.
- The guild system has a [prestige system]($language$/elitemobs/prestige_system.md) which allows players to unlock more ranks and better rewards in exchange for losing all of their EliteMobs progress so far.
- Gear is limited by the guild rank by default, encouraging people to interact more with challenging mechanics.
- There is an antiexploit system which prevents players from easily farming gear by exploiting terrain.
- The trails around procedurally generated Elite Mobs indicates what powers they have.
- Higher level Elites have more, stronger [powers]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=easy-configuration---premade-powers).
- The higher your gear, the higher the level of the elite spawned, the higher the level of the gear it drops.
- All player commands are centralized in the /em command, meaning players don't have to remember any commands other than that one.
- Elite Mobs has Super Mobs, which stacks farm animals when 50 are in close proximity. (This feature will be removed and made into its own plugin in the future.)
- EliteMobs uses the permissionless mode by default, which requires no further setup from admins for the plugin to basically work (though the AG world and the dungeons are strongly recommended).
- EliteMobs was 100% developed by one guy. Send help. Preferably in the form of caffeine. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy) is fine too.
