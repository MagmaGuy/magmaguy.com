As of EliteMobs 7.3.0, it is possible for players to interact with Elite Items in a number of unique ways. This page is meant to help players and admins figure out how the systems work, and later explain the balance of the system for admins.

# Unbinding Items

If you have an item unbind scroll, you are able to use the Unbinder NPC to combine 1 scroll with 1 item in order to unbind it.

***Note: as of writing this, there is no way for players to get the scroll without being given or adding it to as specific boss. The scroll will drop from the Ender Dragon fight which will be released this month.***

The scroll can only be used once. Once unbound, items can be sold or given to other players, or be used after a prestige.

# Scrapping Items

Elite Items can be scrapped at the Scrapper NPC. There is a 50% chance that items will get scrapped correctly. Scrap is the basis for the rest of the Item System.

***

# Repairing Elite Items

Elite Items can be repaired at the Repairman NPC for scrap. The amount repaired is equal to the level and amount of Elite Scrap.

This means that a level 1 elite scrap will repair 1 durability, and that 2 level 50 scrap will repair a total of 100 durability.
