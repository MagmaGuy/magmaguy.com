As of EliteMobs 7.3.0, it is possible for players to interact with Elite Items in a number of unique ways. This page is meant to help players and admins figure out how the systems work, and later explain the balance of the system for admins.


***

# Unbinding Items

If you have an item unbind scroll, you are able to use the Unbinder NPC to combine 1 scroll with 1 item in order to unbind it.

***Note: as of writing this, there is no way for players to get the scroll without being given or adding it to as specific boss. The scroll will drop from the Ender Dragon fight which will be released this month.***

The scroll can only be used once. Once unbound, items can be sold or given to other players, or be used after a prestige.

***

# Scrapping Items

Elite Items can be scrapped at the Scrapper NPC. There is a 50% chance that items will get scrapped correctly. Scrap is the basis for the rest of the Item System.

***

# Upgrading Scrap

Elite Scrap can be upgraded at the Refiner NPC at a rate of 10 scrap of the same level for 1 scrap of a higher level.

***

# Repairing Elite Items

Elite Items can be repaired at the Repairman NPC for scrap. The amount repaired is equal to the level and amount of Elite Scrap.

This means that a level 1 elite scrap will repair 1 durability, and that 2 level 50 scrap will repair a total of 100 durability.

***

# Elite Item Upgrade Orbs

Elite Item Upgrade Orbs can be crafted at the Smelter at a rate of 25 scrap of a level for 1 item upgrade orb of the same level.

***

# Upgrading Elite Items

Elite Items can be upgrade at the Enhancer NPC using 1 Item Upgrade Orb of a higher level than the level of the item. Items will always be upgraded by one level as long as the Elite Item Upgrade Orb is of a higher level than the Elite Item.

This means that a level 50 Elite Item Upgrade Orb will upgrade a level 49 Elite Item into a level 50 Elite Item, but it will also only upgrade a level 1 Elite Item into a level 2 Elite Item.

  <summary>Balance & other technical concerns</summary>

This is an extremely expensive way of upgrading items, and for a good reason.

This system is not meant to replace the "normal" way of obtaining loot. It is a means of accomplishing three discrete objectives:

1. Letting players stick to a weapon or piece of armor they favor. Some bosses drop unique loot, and that unique loot can have interesting effects on it that can't be found elsewhere. However, they can be limited to a certain tier of gear. Using this system, players can persist in using their favorite gear into the later game, at a cost.

2. Allowing players to upgrade unbound weapons and armor. Since items can be unbound using the new unbind system, this means that players will end up having one or more items that they will be very invested in keeping around, since they will be able to use it after triggering the prestige mechanic. These extremely rare and expensive items should be well worth the cost of getting upgraded via scrap for obvious reasons.

3. Quest & arena rewards. The main way most players will obtain scrap and item upgrade orbs will be directly from rewards or killing specific bosses or completing arena challenges. This allows me and admins to create a whole new system of rewards, and while the orbs are expensive to craft, they will be quite inexpensive if players simply receive them directly.

I recommend caution when awarding item upgrade orbs to players. Keep in mind that 1 orb is the distillation of about 50 items of that tier, and therefore these rewards should be reserved for particularly tough and rare bosses!
