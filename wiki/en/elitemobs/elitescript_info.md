# EliteScript

Elitescript is a scripting system for MagmaGuy's Plugins, providing advanced customization options for creating dynamic behaviors for bosses and other entities in Minecraft. 

Elite Scripts can be added as power files or to custom boss files, offering flexibility in implementation. The scripting involves defining events, conditions, zones, actions, and cooldowns.
