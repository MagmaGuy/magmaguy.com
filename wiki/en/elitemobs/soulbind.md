The Soulbind enchantment links all EliteMobs loot to the players the loot drops for. This means that each player gets their own reward from killing an Elite Mob, making sharing loot a non-issue.

Players are unable to pick up loot that isn't soulbound to them from the floor. They are able to pick it up from chests, but are unable to equip them in combat, meaning that they can only really be carried around. This is so players don't accidentally clog up each other's chests with unmovable items. Additionally, players can only sell items soulbound to them.

This enchantment is meant to be used in conjunction with the guild tier loot limiter.


***

Like all enchantments, it can be disabled in the enchantments folder (soulbind.yml, set `isEnabled` to `false`), though this is strongly not recommended.

***Issues caused by removing Soulbind:***
- Elites will no longer drop coins
- Players can give diamond or netherite gear out for free to everyone with a minimal amount of grinding
- The economy will instantly break, allowing veteran players to powerboost players instantly though dozens of ranks
- The loot limiter will no longer work, meaning that players will be able to just wear the armor and weapons of the highest tier players

Admins can remove Soulbind from items using `/em unbind`.

Players can remove soulbind from an item by using an Unbind Scroll. By default this is dropped by the Binder of Worlds, but you can configure other bosses to drop it if you want.
