# Can I make 100% of mobs that spawn Elite Mobs?

It's a really bad idea. You can access the `MobCombatSettings.yml` configuration file and change `eliteMobsSpawnPercentage: 1` to accomplish this.

The only way to do this is to learn Java and writing them yourselves. At that point, you might as well modify the EliteMobs source code.
