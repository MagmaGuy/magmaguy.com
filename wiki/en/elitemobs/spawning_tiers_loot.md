Note: This section talks about normal Elite Mob spawning, not Custom Bosses. It also assume you're using the default configuration settings.

# When does an Elite Mob spawn?

When a normal mob spawns near a player wearing armor. Only armor of at least level 1 will cause Elite Mobs to show up. Higher level armors spawn higher level mobs.
They spawn based on a percentage chance, which is configurable in the MobCombatSettings.yml file.

**If the player gear is not good enough, no Elite Mobs will spawn. If you are just roaming the wilds with no equipment on, you will not find any Elite Mobs.**

## What determines the level of the Elite Mob?

* The level of the mob is the same as the average level of the equipment the player is wearing.

## What determines the level of an item?

* Non-elite items have levels equal to the level of the material (listed below). Elite Items have levels that are *usually* based on the level of the elite killed.

### Material levels
* Trident material: Level 9
* Netherite material: Level 8
* Diamond material: Level 7
* Iron material: Level 6
* Stone / Chain material: Level 5
* Gold / Wood / Leather material: Level 3

# What kind of rewards can I get from Elite Mobs?
Before talking about the special rewards, it's important to note that **only naturally spawned Elite Mobs will drop special loot**. You can not use mob spawners to get special loot. Additionally, the anti cheat mechanisms may remove an Elite Mob's eligibility to drop special loot. This means that if the system detects that you are fighting an Elite Mob which is trapped or which can't reach you for some reason (you're flying / on a tower / it's in a hole) it will cease to show its power trail and will no longer drop any special loot.
Elite Mobs can drop three types of special items: procedurally generated items, custom items and unique items. Additionally, they drop more vanilla loot than regular mobs. The drop chance is not 100%, but the odds of getting loot increase with the mob level.

## What's a procedurally generated item?
Procedurally generated items are items that are generated semi-randomly based on the server's configuration settings. There is a nearly endless amount of possibilities for procedurally generated items. Usually procedurally generated items are armor, weapons and tools of any material quality with varying enchantment quantities and levels.

## What's a custom item?
Custom items are items either preloaded in the plugin (such as MagmaGuy's toothpick and charms) or added by admins. These items are fully customized, and can give players potion effects when either worn or held in the main hand or offhand.

## What's a unique item?
Unique items are special drops from Custom Bosses which are similar to custom items. They may sometimes also have unique powers, such as the flamethrower power for the Zombie King's axe.

# How can I get better loot?
The higher the level of Elite Mob killed, the better the item dropped!
