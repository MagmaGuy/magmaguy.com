# Creating EliteMobs content

Making content for EliteMobs is easy and can be done in just a few minutes!

You will find in the sidebar links to create all kind of content, from bosses, to events, to entire dungeons!

## Before you start

You can make all the content through the [webapp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html), which makes the process much faster.

All configuration files use the yml/yaml file format. This is the normal file format for Minecraft configuration files.

YML is basically a text file that follows specific formatting rules for specific data. If you plan to create a lot of EliteMobs content, and are just getting started, you may want to check [this page]($langage$/global/configuration_file_guide.md) which shows how the text files should be written to be in a valid yml format.
