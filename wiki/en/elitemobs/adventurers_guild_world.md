# Adventurer's Guild World

### What's the Adventure's Guild World?

The Adventurer's Guild World is the name of a premade world made for EliteMobs by Realm of Lotheridon.

### What is the Adventurer's Guild World for?

The Adventurer's Guild World acts as a hub for EliteMobs. By hosting the hub, players no longer have to memorize any commands (other than /em) in order to interact with EliteMobs.

In the world, the following NPCs are placed ahead of time:

- Guild Attendant (for upgrading guild ranks)
- Blacksmith (for buying procedurally generated items and selling drops from elite mobs)
- Special Blacksmith (for buying custom items and selling drops from elite mobs)
- Quest Giver (for browsing and accepting quests)
- Combat Instructor (for giving tips about EliteMobs combat)
- Barkeep (currently unimplemented)
- Transporter (for going back to your previous location)

Additionally, features an adventurer's guild building for the NPCs, as well as an EliteMobs Arena (currently unimplemented, coming soon!).

### How to set up the Adventurer's Guild World

To install the Adventurer's Guild World do the following:

1. Download the files. You can click on the red glass in `/em setup` to get links to the downloads.

2. Upload / move the files to your server's `/plugins/EliteMobs/imports` folder. Make sure you put the **ZIPPED** files inside the `imports` folder without modifying them in any way, EliteMobs will automatically extract the files and move them to the correct locations.

3. Restart or do `/em reload`. After a few seconds, when you do `/em setup` the indicators for the features you downloaded should be yellow.


   **IMPORTANT: [WORLDGUARD](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) AND [WORLDEDIT](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) (or [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/)) ARE MANDATORY IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL SOME OF THE CONTENT IN ELITEMOBS!**

4. Click on the yellow glass in the `/em setup` menu to install the imported features. If everything installed properly you should be in the Adventurer's Guild hub world. You can teleport to the Adventurer's Guild at any time by doing `/ag`.
