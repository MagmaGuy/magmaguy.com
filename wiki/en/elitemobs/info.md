# What is EliteMobs for?

EliteMobs aims to extend the end-game of Minecraft by implementing bosses and boss-related content.

This means:
- Dynamic Bosses
- Custom Bosses
- Event Bosses
- Arenas
- Open-World Dungeons
- Instanced Dungeons
- Open-World random dungeons (with BetterStructures integration)
- Custom Items
- ... and more!

Simultaneously, EliteMobs does not seek to replace vanilla Minecraft content, but rather build around it. As such, players are able to avoid EliteMobs content, and EliteMobs items generally do not affect PvP or vanilla Minecraft combat (the damage and defense bonuses from elite items don't apply outside of combat with EliteMobs)

# For admins & server owners

This plugin is made for survival and survival-like (skyblock, skywars, heavily modded survival variants) servers.

The plugin is meant to be usable simply by dragging and dropping the server jar into the server. The default settings are the ones I use on my own servers and are subject to tweaks as time goes on.

**However!** The ability to customize EliteMobs has been a very high priority throughout the development process. Almost every aspect of the plugin can be translated, customized, disabled or modified.

# For other developers

Despite the GPLV3 and open-source nature of this project, I am neither looking for nor will I accept any code additions or changes at this time. I welcome forks of the plugin, and would take immense pleasure to see what you might do with them; however, this is my first massive programming project and as such is also a learning experience.

**However!** Do not take this as me claiming I am beyond any criticism or that I won't listen to feedback - quite the opposite, I love it when people point out better ways of accomplishing things I've done in the plugin. I wish for this project to be something that I wrote end to end, with no code snippets that I am not aware of or that I don't understand.
