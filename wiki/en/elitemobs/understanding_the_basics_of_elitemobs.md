Here you will find described as briefly as I can the intended gameplay loop for EliteMobs. This guide is aimed at new admins who want to get a grasp of what EliteMobs can do.

# Step 1: Player's first encounter
A player in your server will acquire armor during normal gameplay. Once they have anything at iron level or better, they will start facing Elite Mobs which spawn naturally around them based on the armor the players are wearing.
These Elite Mobs (when their level is high enough and the antiexploit system isn't triggered) can drop three types of loot:

* Procedurally generated loot (the most common kind)
* Custom loot (somewhat rare)
* Elite Coins

(Note: You can read more about Elite Mob spawning and rewards [here]($language$/elitemobs/spawning_tiers_loot.md))

Upon looting, the player will be informed by the plugin that the coins can be used and the items sold at the store in the Adventurer's Guild.

# Step 2: Discovering the economy
Once the player has gotten the information about selling items, they'll naturally be drawn to sell it. If the world is set up, they will then find the Adventurer's Guild NPCs (details for world download and setup and in the spigot resource post).

They will find out that EliteMobs uses its own currency, which is necessary for balance reasons. They will also find out that they can unlock guild tiers, and will later discover that this is required if they wish to progress beyond level 10 elite mobs, as they won't get loot beyond tier 10 without unlocking more ranks. They will also be able to find out about the quest system, and start fulfilling quests to get extra currency, which will naturally lead them to seek opponents they would otherwise avoid. They may also find the Combat Instructor NPC, which will give them tips about the combat system. Globally, all NPCs give players important advice as they simply chat with them.

# Step 3: Progression
Now that the players have an idea of what's ahead of them, they will fight against increasingly stronger Elite Mobs as they progress through item tiers. By the time they reach diamond tier, they will find themselves capped by their guild tier, which should encourage them to unlock further tiers. Additionally, they will encounter random events which should increase their interest in the various mechanics that the plugin has to offer, especially when it comes to custom enchantments such as the flamethrower.

# Step 4: High Tiers
Once the player has progressed up to around item tier 80 (or guild tier 8), they will start maxing out the difficulty of EliteMobs (for now). High level combat requires quite a lot more strategy, planning and combat execution than lower levels, as mobs have up to 7 different powers by that stage. They will be able to tell which loot they want to keep and which they want to discard, and will have a good idea of which are their favorite custom items. I highly recommend you make a lot of custom items as these are currently the main focus of mid to top tier players of EliteMobs.

# (Mini)Dungeoneering
Assuming you installed the recommended Minidungeons & Lairs at some point - possibly even rather early on - players will probably be drawn to challenge Lairs, Minidungeons and Adventures. These are locations where Custom Bosses spawn and, after being killed, respawn on a delay, creating a centralized location where players can challenge tough bosses in a fair way.
Here are the main selling points of the minidungeons:
* Since the terrain is premade and protected, and so are the bosses, combat can't be exploited
* Since it centralizes combat, you can have lower spawn rates for natural mobs and end up with a lower overall performance impact
* Since the loot is premade, it is usually quite special, and players learn to go to certain places to farm for specific gear that they might like
* Since the bosses are premade, the battles are manually balanced and it results in far more interesting & challenging but fair fights
* In the case of adventures, these are full-on massive adventure maps with vast questlines, sidequests and sometimes even arenas and dungeons inside of dungeons!
* It looks great and players love spending days in them

# Dungeoneering
Dungeons are instanced challenges. This means that a world is created when a group joins the dungeon, and once the group starts the dungeon players will be unable to join other than to spectate it. There is a dedicated system for respawning which gives players 3 deaths each before being struck out.

Dungeons are the most balanced and developed content in EliteMobs, as they are significantly harder to exploit than any other content.

Dungeons have difficulties to pick from, and the highest difficulties are the hardest challenges in EliteMobs but also the most rewarding!

# Arenas
EliteMobs also has arenas which players can challenge. These are wave-based challenges which players must overcome for a preset amount of waves. They reward players for reaching specific arena waves. This content is also instanced, and the join and respawn limitations from the Dungeoneering section also applies here.

Arenas can be quite hard to beat, so they make for a fun and rewarding challenge!
