As of EliteMobs 7.2, Elite Mobs use an advanced aggro system for damage dealt to Elites.

*Note: aggro is the name given to the mechanic that determines which player the boss targets for their attacks*

In the advanced aggro system, all Elites will target the highest damager among the group of players attacking them if there is more than one player attacking.

This means that simply kiting bosses around while another player kills them is impossible, and also means that high level players can't use lower level meat shields to take all the damage while they kill the boss.

If the damage is balanced among players, the boss will switch between targets fairly regularly, keeping all players on their toes.

This system is heavily used in our [Instanced Dungeons](https://magmaguy.com/wiki.html#en+elitemobs+instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md) where the players are expected to assume roles of Tanks and DPS. [Instanced Dungeons](https://magmaguy.com/wiki.html#en+elitemobs+instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md) will even have loot drops that were made specifically for Tank roles. These loot drops will have a special enchantment called [Loud Strikes](https://magmaguy.com/wiki.html#en+elitemobs+custom_enchantments_list.md%loud-strikes) that will draw aggro from any Elites that the player hits.
