The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier. By default, players are limited in the following ways (assuming you're using the default settings):


Guild tier 1 (starting default): up to tier 10 items, level 10 mobs

Guild tier 2: up to tier 20 items, level 20 mobs

Guild tier 3: up to tier 30 items, level 30 mobs

Guild tier 4: up to tier 40 items, level 40 mobs

Guild tier 5: up to tier 50 items, level 50 mobs

Guild tier 6: up to tier 60 items, level 60 mobs

Guild tier 7: up to tier 70 items, level 70 mobs

Guild tier 8: up to tier 80 items, level 80 mobs

Guild tier 9: up to tier 90 items, level 90 mobs

Guild tier 10: up to tier 100 items, level 100 mobs

From point on, prestige levels are required in order to unlock the guild tiers.

Prestige 1 Guild tier 11: up to tier 110 items, level 110 mobs

Prestige 2 Guild tier 12: up to tier 120 items, level 120 mobs

Prestige 3 Guild tier 13: up to tier 130 items, level 130 mobs

Prestige 4 Guild tier 14: up to tier 140 items, level 140 mobs

Prestige 5 Guild tier 15: up to tier 150 items, level 150 mobs

Prestige 6 Guild tier 16: up to tier 160 items, level 160 mobs

Prestige 7 Guild tier 17: up to tier 170 items, level 170 mobs

Prestige 8 Guild tier 18: up to tier 180 items, level 180 mobs

Prestige 9 Guild tier 19: up to tier 180 items, level 190 mobs

Prestige 10 Guild tier 20: up to tier 200 items, level 200 mobs

# How this works & edge cases
Since the guild tier limits the tier of the item that players can kill, this means that players can only spawn mobs up to a certain level as the level of the mob is based on the gear the player is wearing. Should players go hunt mobs with higher level friends, the loot that they will get will be of a lower level than their friends'. Combined with the soulbind enchantment, this curbs the issue of powerleveling quite a bit and allows admins to not have to worry about visitors reaching the maximum tier within a few minutes of joining the server / new players instantly getting loads of diamond tier items. Additionally, it gives players a deeper connection with their loot, as it makes it belong to them and only them.
