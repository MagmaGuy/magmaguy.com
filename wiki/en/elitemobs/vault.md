As of 7.1.0, by popular demand, you are now able to turn on Vault to unify the EliteMobs economy with your server's economy.

***Now here's why that's a bad idea:***

EliteMobs has no leveling system. The progression system is tied to getting better items through killing Elite Mobs and buying higher guild ranks to access higher level loot, higher level mobs, higher level quests and, soon, higher level arena challenges and dungeons.

Additionally, EliteMobs has a very delicate balance when it come to purchasing charms and reselling loot obtained from Elite Mobs.

***Therefore, if you join your server's economy to the EliteMobs economy, players will be able to easily buy their way top, potentially bypassing the learning curve.***

Now the progression system won't work properly, which leads to even worse problems. High level Elite Mobs have various powers, and players are meant to slowly learn those powers through fighting against them for dozens of hours, learning how to identify the powers that the Elite Mobs have and how to counter those powers, as well as learning how to prepare to go into combat against Elite Mobs.

If players skip straight to the endgame, they will feel like the combat difficulty is nearly impossible and extremely unfair, as they will not have had the time to develop the knowledge required to kill the EliteMobs efficiently through long hours of play.

You can enable Vault compatibility in the `EconomySettings.yml` configuration file.
