# Introduction

On this page, you'll discover various examples of custom boss powers created with EliteScript and the [WebApp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html). These straightforward examples illustrate how to utilize multiple actions and other features to craft unique boss powers. 

Additionally, visual demonstrations accompany each example, so it is easier to understand how the script operates within the game.

Feel free to copy any of the examples and use them in your own dungeons or worlds.

## Power Examples

### Slam Down

This script will cause the boss to teleport 8 blocks above the player who dealt damage to it, then slam into the ground. Afterward, it will apply the slow potion effect to any players within 3 blocks of the boss, and display the message 'Stunned' on screen for 3 seconds.

### Push Away

This script will generate a 4-block dome around the boss. Subsequently, it will initiate a particle effect at the zone border, lasting for one second, then another action will push away any players within the zone. Due to the offset setting for the push, players will be slightly propelled upwards. Finally, the script will send a message to any players within the zone.

### Arrow Rain

Makes a script that will draw a circle on the ground around the player that damaged the mob, it also shows a message on the screen telling the player to move out of the circle. Then 2 seconds later it will fire arrows downwards at that same location just from 10 blocks up.

### Fire Aura

This will create a script that will spawn particles around the boss using the cylinder zone, it will last 6 seconds. The boss will also be given the tag `FireOn` for 6 seconds. 

Should the players attack the boss while the tag is active then the players will get set on fire for 1 second. This is done using conditions, the `SetOnFire` script will only be able to execute if the boss has the matching tag `FireOn`.

### Poison Lines

This script will create two cuboid zones centered on the boss. The boss AI is set to be off for 2 seconds. The cuboid zones are configured in such a way that they will form a plus symbol on the ground.

The script will then make cloud particles for 2 seconds in the zones and then it will make smoke particles and apply poison potion effect to the zones for 3 seconds.

### Bounce

This script creates a 10 block cylinder zone centered on the boss and then it applies particle effects and push to the zone for 10 seconds.

The push action pushes the players slightly upwards every tick, creating the illusion that the players are bouncing around while they are in the zone.

### Summon

This script will create a cylindrical zone (positioned 6 blocks above the player due to the applied offset) centered around the player who damaged the boss. Additionally, it will display a message on screen to that player.

After a delay of 2 seconds, reinforcements will spawn into the designated zone. However, only a portion of the zone will be occupied by reinforcements since we used `coverage`. If the player fails to eliminate all the reinforcements, they will automatically despawn after 20 seconds (400 ticks).

### Potion Zones

This script is activated when a player damages the boss. It then executes either the `PotionZoneBad` or `PotionZoneGood` script.

In the `PotionZoneBad` script, a cylindrical zone is generated around nearby players that are within 20 blocks from the boss. It produces cloud and large smoke particle effects with a specified coverage, inflicts the wither potion effect, and delivers a message to nearby players.

In the `PotionZoneGood` script, a cylindrical zone is generated around players that are within 20 blocks from the boss. The particle effects for this script are inverted. This script applies a healing potion effect instead of wither and sends a message to nearby players.

### Blind Waves

This script initiates two ground ray waves projected in both positive and negative X directions originating from the boss.

We utilize the `offset` parameter to determine the length and size of the rays, specifically by defining the Z value. Additionally, we specify the direction of wave propagation by setting the X values. (This is just an explanation on how this specific script uses these values, you don't have to make yours exactly like this)

While it's possible to adjust the Y values to increase the height of the ray waves, we leave it at 0 to allow players the option to jump over the rays.

The parameter `animationDuration` dictates the time taken for the ray waves to travel from targets to final targets. Reducing this value would make the rays faster and more challenging to evade.

Subsequently, particle and potion effects are applied. Players failing to avoid or jump over the ray waves will be blinded for 5 seconds (100 ticks).

### Freeze Wall

This script creates 3 rotating rays centered on the boss. We need 3 different rotating rays since we cannot define ray height so we use several scripts and `offset` to make the rays stack in height so they appear like one singular rotating *wall*.

All 3 scripts have identical zones except the `offset` being different. They are set to be 6 blocks in length starting from the boss and are set to do a 360 degree yaw rotation in 10 seconds (200 ticks).

All scripts have particles effects set and will apply the `VISUAL_FREEZE` action for 5 seconds (100 ticks) to any players that are *hit* by the ray walls.
