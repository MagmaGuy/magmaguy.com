# What's Nightmare mode?
Nightmare mode is an EliteMobs mode where a world gets very short daylight cycles (4x speed) and normal length night times. Additionally, the normal Elite Mob spawn rate is increased by 50% (by default). This game mode also prevents players from sleeping, although they will still be able to set their homes.

# What's nightmare mode for?
Nightmare mode is made **not** to be the main game mode but to be used on a map dedicated to hunting Elite Mobs. It fixes the issue some server networks have where some players want to skip the night while others want to go out hunting. By creating a new map where night time is almost always permanent, players will be able to hunt to their heart's content.

You can activate this game mode on the ValidWorlds.yml folder.

In order to activate it, follow this format:
