The following is the full wiki of the betterfood plugin!

A very small and simple as can be plugin that automatically makes players eat cooked and crafted food from their inventories.

<div align="center">

The list of valid items is as follows:

</div>

|    Valid Items     |
|:------------------:|
|       Apples       |
|   Baked potatoes   |
|   Beetroot soup    |
|       Bread        |
|    Cooked beef     |
|   Cooked chicken   |
|     Cooked cod     |
|   Cooked mutton    |
|  Cooked porkchop   |
|   Cooked rabbit    |
|   Cooked salmon    |
|      Cookies       |
|     Dried kelp     |
|    Melon slices    |
|   Mushroom stew    |
|    Pumpkin pie     |
|    Rabbit stew     |
|   Sweet berries    |

# Why?

Honestly I never liked how Mojang implemented the food system. It constantly takes players out of what they're doing in order to fill up a meaningless bar. 
<br>I do understand that food is important for a survival game, but I think holding down right click for a few seconds every couple of minutes does not make for a compelling game mechanic.





What about other foods?
Raw foods and foods that give buffs are best left to manage by the player. I would not want players to waste raw food they're harvesting for cooking, nor am I making this plugin to make people lazier about food. 

If people are willing to put the effort in to cook or craft their food, they get to have it refill automatically. Sounds like a good balance, right?

# Permissions/Commands/Configs:

- betterfood.user - Plugin only applies to players with this permission.
- /betterfood toggleEating - Toggles automatic healing for the player.
- /betterfood toggleMessage - Toggles eating messages for the player.


The following is the full wiki of the betterstructures plugin!

# BetterStructures Commands

Below is a comprehensive list of commands available for use with the BetterStructures plugin, along with their respective required permissions.

## Reload Command

**Command:** `/betterstructures reload`

**Permission:** `betterstructures.*`

**Description:** Reloads the plugin. Also imports any structures that need to be imported.

## Lootify Command

**Command:** `/betterstructures lootify <treasure filename> <rarity> <minAmount> <maxAmount> <weight>`

**Permission:** `betterstructures.*`

**Description:** Adds the currently held item to the specific `rarity` table of the specific `generator`, randomizing the amount of the item that can be found in a chest between `minAmount` and `maxAmount`, with the `weight` specified.

This is a very specific system, for more details on how these values work you can read [this page]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md).

## Place Command

**Command:** `/betterstructures place <structure filename> <generator type>`

**Permission:** `betterstructures.*`

**Description:** Forces placement of selected structure at your location.

## Teleportcoords Command

**Command:** `/betterstructures teleporttocoords <worldName> <x> <y> <z>`

**Permission:** `betterstructures.*`

**Description:** Not meant to be used directly, this is the command that runs when an admin clicks on a chat warning that lets them teleport to a structure.

## Version Command

**Command:** `/betterstructures version`

**Permission:** `betterstructures.*`

**Description:** Outputs the plugin version on chat.

## Silent Command

**Command:** `/betterstructures silent`

**Permission:** `betterstructures.*`

**Description:** Silences or removes silence from warnings appearing in chat for server operators about structures getting generated in the server.

## Generators

Generators are the most powerful part of the configuration system for BetterStructures. By default there are 27 generators which collectively manage over 200 builds currently distributed by BetterStructures, and while you can create your own generators, you can also use existing ones as a shortcut.

Generators tell the plugin where exactly things should spawn and define loot tables. The default generators are also named in ways that should be very easy to guess what they do.

The only mandatory field for generators is the `structureType` setting, which tells the plugin if the building is meant to spawn in the sky, shallow underground, deep underground, surface or surface liquid.

***

### isEnabled

Sets whether the generator is enabled.

***

### structureType

Sets what kind of structure the build is. **Note that you can make a list of several types!** 

The following are valid structure type values:

***

#### surface

```yml
structureType: 
- SURFACE
```

Surface structures spawn at the surface of the world. The only exception is the Nether environment, where it spawns at points the plugin deems to be sufficiently surface-like.

***

#### sky

```yml
structureType: 
- SKY
```

Sky structures spawn between 80 to 120 blocks above the air, configurable in config.yml. The only exception is the Nether environment, where it spawns at points the plugin deems to be sufficiently air-like.

***

#### underground_shallow

```yml
structureType: 
- UNDERGROUND_SHALLOW
```

Underground shallow structures spawn between y=0 and y=60 in the overworld, y=60 and y=120 in the nether and any valid underground height in the End.

_**Note: ** You will notice there are two underground settings. This is because only having one results in having a very sparse underground, as Minecraft has a lot of underground space and players will often times miss underground structure simply because they didn't mine into them. This also guarantees that there is an even spread across different depths._

***

#### underground_deep

```yml
structureType: 
- UNDERGROUND_DEEP
```

Underground deep structures spawn between y=-64 and y=0 in the overworld, y=0 and y=60 in the nether and do not spawn in the End.

***

#### liquid_surface

```yml
structureType: 
- LIQUID_SURFACE
```

Liquid surface structures will spawn on liquids. In the case of the overworld, they will spawn on water, and almost always on oceans. In the case of the Nether, they will spawn in the lava lakes. They will not spawn in the End.

***

### lowestYLevel

Sets the lowest Y level (altitude) the structure will spawn in.

***

### highestYLevel

Sets the highest Y level (altitude) the structure will spawn in.

***

### validWorlds

Sets the list of worlds the structure will spawn in. **If no list is present, it will use all worlds allowed by the plugin**, unless otherwise limited (such as by the environment type or biomes).

***

### validWorldEnvironments

Sets the list of world environments the structure will spawn in. **If no list is present, it will use all world environments allowed by the plugin**. Valid values: `NORMAL`, `NETHER`, `END` and `CUSTOM`.

***

### validBiomes

Sets the list of valid biomes the structure will spawn in. **If no list is defined, it will assume every biome is valid!**.

This requires using the list of biomes as defined by the [Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html).

***

### treasureFilename

Sets the treasure file that the generator will use. This sets what spawns in the chests for all builds that use this generator, unless a different value is set in a [schematic configuration's `treasureFile` setting]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md&section=treasurefile).

# Creating content

***

## Creating the build

There are no restrictions with what you can build for BetterStructures, although it is recommended to keep the size of the structures under 100x100x100 blocks for general world fit and performance reasons. That being said, it can easily handle structure much larger structures.

***

### Special blocks

BetterStructures has two special blocks: barriers and bedrock. Any other block that WorldEdit / FAWE can paste will be pasted normally, but barriers and bedrock blocks are the exception. Instead of pasting, these blocks get replaced with the following custom behaviors:

***

#### Barrier

Barrier blocks make the plugin not place any blocks at that location. This means that whatever block was originally there in the normal world generation will remain there.

Builders can use this to round the edges of a paste, making it look more natural, or to mold walls to a potential cave, among other tricks.

***

#### Bedrock

Bedrock blocks make the plugin guarantee that there is a solid block at that location. This means that if a solid block is already there in the default world generation, that block will not be modified; however, if the block is air or liquid, it will be replaced with a solid block from the [pedestal](#pedestalmaterial).

Builders can use this to create floors with features such as the floor for minecart rails or guarantee that a floor exists without overriding potentially already existing solid blocks at that location in the world, making the builds look more organic.

***

### Spawn signs

BetterStructures can use signs with specific text to spawn mobs and even bosses from EliteMobs and MythicMobs at specific locations of the build.

***

##### Spawning vanilla mobs

If you take a normal sign and place it somewhere, then make sure the first line says `[spawn]` and the second line has the [entity type name following the Spigot API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html) you will spawn a persistent entity at that location of the type you specified.

As an example, if you have a sign that says `[spawn]` on the first line and `ZOMBIE` on the second line, you will spawn a zombie at that location when the build gets placed. This can also be used for non-living entities such as armor stands or ender crystals.

<div class="minecraft-sign"> 
<p>[spawn]</p>
<p>ZOMBIE</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>

***

##### Spawning Elite Mobs (recommended boss plugin)

BetterStructures also has advanced EliteMobs integration, which allows it to create boss arenas based on builds and spawn signs.

If you take a normal sign and place it somewhere, making the first line [elitemobs] then you can use all other lines to say what boss file to use.

As an example, if you do `[elitemobs]` on the first line and then `test_boss.yml`, on the second line, you will spawn the test boss. If you have a very long filename such as boss_with_very_long_filename.yml, you can break it up into multiple lines, so make line 2 `boss_with_very_` and then line 3 `long_filename.yml` and that will work.

As a reminder, by default the combat arenas will be protected until players kill all the bosses in the build if your server is using WorldGuard.

<div class="minecraft-sign"> 
<p>[elitemobs]</p>
<p>test_boss_with</p>
<p>_a_long_name</p>
<p>.yml</p>
</div>

***

##### Spawning Mythic Mobs

BetterStructures also has simple MythicMobs integration, which allows it to spawn a mob from MythicMobs into the build. On the first line of a normal sign write `[mythicmobs]`, then on the second line use the mob identified. You can use a number on the third line to set the level of the mob.

<div class="minecraft-sign"> 
<p>[mythicmobs]</p>
<p>my_mythic_boss</p>
<p>1</p>
<p></p>
</div>

***

## Schematics

Schematics are files generated by WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit which contain the blocks for the build that BetterStructures will be using. 

Detailed instructions on how to make a schematic are not included here, as they are thoroughly detailed on the WorldEdit and FastAsyncWorldEdit documentations, but it is generally done by:

1) pick a corner of the build and use the command `//pos1`
2) pick the diagonally opposite corner and use the command `//pos2`
3) use the `//copy` command
4) use the command `/schem save <schematicname>` where `<schematicName>` is the filename you want to use for your schematic.

<img src="https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/_images/cuboid.png" alt="worldedit documentation image from their docs">

*Make sure you run the command `//pos1` on point 1 and `//pos2` on point 2!*

***

#### Anchor point

Anchor points are where you run the `//copy` command for the schematic. When simply pasting a schematic, these are where you are standing relative to the build.

Anchor points are important to get right for the schematics to work correctly.

* For _surface builds_, it is recommended you stand at the lowest point of the floor when copying the build.
* For _underground builds_, it is recommended you stand on top of the build.
* For _liquid builds_, it is recommended you stand on top of the water.
* For _air builds_, it is recommended that you stand on top of the build.

**Please note that you should always be very close or directly on top of the builds when copying - the farther away you are, the laggier it will be when the build needs to be pasted.**

***

# Schematic configurations

Every schematic file has a schematic configuration. If a schematic file has just been added to the server, the configuration will be generated after a restart or after a `/betterstructures reload`.

These configurations allow you to set the following settings for the schematic paste:

***

## isEnabled

Sets whether the schematic is enabled. If disabled, it will not be placed anywhere.

***

## weight

Weight sets the weight of the schematic in terms of how likely it is to get picked.

The default value is `1.0`. If you make a build have a `2.0` weight, it will be 2x more likely of getting selected than the other builds. If you make it `0.5`, it will have half the chances of getting picked.

_**Note:** Keep in mind that the odds of a specific build getting picked change drastically based on how many build there are in total competing for the location that will be getting a structure!_

***

## pedestalMaterial

**Important: optional field!**

Pedestal material sets the material type of the pedestal blocks using the [spigot api material names](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html) - use them or it won't work!

Pedestals are the blocks that get placed under surface and underground buildings to fit any air gaps and improve a building's fit with the world. These are also the same blocks that replace bedrock blocks in the schematic.

When nothing is defined in the configuration, the blocks under the location for the paste get analyzed and the best fit gets selected as the material for the best integrated look.

***

## generatorConfigFilename

This option sets the name of the configuration file, by file name, that the schematic will be using. This requires the full filename, including the `.yml` extension at the end. As an example, `generatorConfigFilename: generator_surface_global.yml` would be the correct option if you want to use the generator defined in `generator_surface_global.yml` which you can find in the generators configuration folder.

***

## treasureFile

Sets the [treasure file]($language$/betterstructures/creating_treasure.md) that this structure will use, overwriting the treasure file set by the structure's [generator]($language$/betterstructures/creating_generators.md). This is generally not recommended unless it is for a very special build. It is generally better to modify or create a generator for this purpose.


# Customizing content

Everything distributed in BetterStructures is editable. You are able to modify any schematic files and generator settings to your liking.

The content creation guide above is also a guide that can help you edit existing content.

# What is a treasure file?

Treasure files are what determine the loot tables for BetterStructures chests. They are usually assigned
to [generators]($language$/betterstructures/creating_generators.md&section=treasurefilename) but they can also be set at the
level of an [individual build configuration]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md&section=treasurefile).

These loot tables are quite powerful, but also require knowledge of some basic statistics concepts to understand.

<details>
<summary>
Read about those concepts here, the rest of the page assumes you understand them!
</summary>

***Weighted probability***

BetterStructures and EliteMobs frequently use the concept of weighted probability. This is to solve a simple problem: how can you set the chance of picking one item from a list of potentially infinite items?

Weighted probability solves this issue by giving each item a weight. If you have 100 items and each has a weight of 1, then they all have an equal chance - 1% - of getting picked. If you add one more item, bringing the total to 101 items, you and give that last item a chance of 1, all items still have the same chance - ~0.99% - of getting picked. If you give the last item a weight of 2, the chance of it getting picked increases - the new total weight is 102, the last element has a weight of 2 and 100/102 = ~0.98% so 0.98%+0.98% = 1.96% chance of getting picked. If you give the last item a weight of 100, the new weight is 200, and since half of that weight is your new item, you new item has a 50% chance of getting picked.

As you can see, this is good to use when you might have lists of hundreds of things to randomize from.

***Gaussian distribution***

A gaussian distribution is a bell-shaped mathematical function.

<img src="http://sfonline.barnard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gaussian-distribution.jpg">

You might be wondering how this is relevant to the loot system. One thing BetterStructures has to decide when setting loot in chests is just how much loot appears in those chests. The amount should be consistently around a specific number, but ideally not so predictable that opening a chest might become less exciting.

To achieve this semi-random effect, gaussian distribution is used to randomize *how many* items are picked. Once this amount is picked, the *weighted probability* picks one element from the rarity table at random and taking the weights into account.

So how does the gaussian distribution work?

Fortunately, you don't have to worry about how the math behind it works, and can instead focus on the two settings that modify it: mean and standard deviation.

*Mean*

To put it simply, `mean` sets the middle of the gaussian curve, which means it sets the most likely amount of items that will appear in a chest. Essentially, if you want your chests to usually have 5 items, set your mean to 5.

*Standard deviation*

Imagine the average number of items in a chest is 5. The `standard deviation` helps decide how much this number can change from one chest to another.

Small `Standard Deviation` (e.g., 1): This means most chests will have items very close to the average, like 4, 5, or 6 items. It's a more predictable experience. For example, if a chest has a standard deviation of 1, you can expect almost all chests to have between 4 to 6 items.

Medium `Standard Deviation` (e.g., 2): Here, there's more variety. Chests might have 3 to 7 items. While 5 items are still common, it's not unusual to find chests with a bit more or less. So, with a standard deviation of 2, you might occasionally find a chest with only 3 items, or if you're lucky, one with 7 items.

Large `Standard Deviation` (e.g., 3 or more): Now things get really surprising! Chests could have as few as 2 items or as many as 8 or more. It means you might find a chest with just a couple of items, but there's also a chance of finding a chest loaded with goodies. For instance, with a standard deviation of 3, a chest could have anywhere from 2 to 8 items, making each chest opening an exciting gamble.

***The default mean is 4, and the default standard deviation is 3.***

</details>

***

# Special format

Treasure files have a special format that looks like this:

```yml
isEnabled: true
mean: 4.0
standardDeviation: 3.0
items:
  common:
    weight: 60
    items:
    - amount: 1-1
      material: STONE_PICKAXE
      procedurallyGenerateEnchantments: true
      weight: 1.0
    - amount: 1-1
      material: STONE_SHOVEL
      procedurallyGenerateEnchantments: true
      weight: 1.0
  rare:
    weight: 30
    items:
    - amount: 1-1
      material: ANVIL
      weight: 6.0
    - amount: 1-6
      material: BEETROOT
      weight: 6.0
  epic:
    weight: 10
    items:
    - amount: 2-10
      material: DIAMOND
      weight: 1.0
    - amount: 1-1
      material: DIAMOND_AXE
      weight: 6.0
procedurallyGeneratedItemSettings:
  golden_sword:
    bane_of_arthropods:
      minLevel: 1
      maxLevel: 5
      chance: 0.2
    looting:
      minLevel: 1
      maxLevel: 3
      chance: 0.2

```

*Note: this is a very trimmed down version of the file, the actual file is 2599 lines long as it covers far more loot and every possible enchantment.*

# isEnabled

| Key |       Values        | Default |
|-|:-------------------:|-|
| `isEnabled` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `true` |

***

# mean

| Key    |      Values       | Default |
|--------|:-----------------:|---------|
| `mean` | [Double](#double) | `4`     |

Set the `mean`. Read the details about that [here](#what-is-a-treasure-file).

***

# standardDeviation

| Key                 |      Values       | Default |
|---------------------|:-----------------:|---------|
| `standardDeviation` | [Double](#double) | `3`     |

Set the `standardDeviation`. Read the details about that [here](#what-is-a-treasure-file).

***

# items

This is where it gets a tricky, as many of the options can be set by admins. Let's zoom in on the configuration file example from earlier.

```yml
items:
  common:
    weight: 60
    items:
    - amount: 1-1
      material: STONE_PICKAXE
      procedurallyGenerateEnchantments: true
      weight: 1.0
    - amount: 1-1
      material: STONE_SHOVEL
      procedurallyGenerateEnchantments: true
      weight: 1.0
  rare:
    weight: 30
    items:
    - amount: 1-1
      material: ANVIL
      weight: 6.0
    - amount: 1-6
      material: BEETROOT
      weight: 6.0
```

Here, you can see that under the `items` configuration key we have a map with `common` and `rare`. These are `rarities`!
***

## rarities

Rarities do not have a fixed name. You can add or remove them, and customize them as much as you want, as long as you use the same format.

Note that what makes these rarity tables more or less rare is the `weight` of the loot table!

By default:
- `common` has a default `weight` of 60
- `rare` has a default `weight` of 30
- `epic` has a default `weight` of 10

Making common items 6x more likely to drop than epic items. You can read more about [`weight`s here](#what-is-a-treasure-file)!

Aside from the weight, each rarity table has its own list of `items`.

***

### rarity items

Rarity items are a [map list]($language$/global/configuration_file_guide.md&section=map_list) which lists all the items that the rarity table has.

There items have the following settings:

| Key                                |           Values            | Default  |
|------------------------------------|:---------------------------:|----------|
| `amount`                           | min-max [Integer](#integer) | variable |
| `material`                         |    [Material](#Material)    | variable |
| `procedurallyGenerateEnchantments` |     [Boolean](#boolean)     | variable |
| `weight`                           |      [Double](#double)      | variable |

***

#### amount

***

Sets the amount to drop. This is expressed as a range as follows `amount: MIN-MAX`. As an example, to drop between 1 to 5
items: `amount: 1-5`.

#### material

Sets the material using the [Spigot API names](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html) of the
item to potentially drop.

***

##### Special case - serialized

When using the lootify command, instead of a material lootify will provide a `serialized` setting. This is automatically generated by the plugin and should not be manually generated. Is it in a format that is no human-readable.

***

#### weight

Sets the weight for the weighted chance. More about that [here](#what-is-a-treasure-file).

***

#### procedurallyGenerateItems

Sets whether the item should be procedurally generated based on the configuration settings if `procedurallyGeneratedItemSettings`. Note that based on the settings this might result in an item generating without enchantments regardless.


# procedurallyGeneratedItemSettings

Let's take another look at our configuration file example:

```yml
procedurallyGeneratedItemSettings:
  golden_sword:
    bane_of_arthropods:
      minLevel: 1
      maxLevel: 5
      chance: 0.2
    looting:
      minLevel: 1
      maxLevel: 3
      chance: 0.2
```

As you can see, this file lists material types, followed by enchantments and then followed by minimum and maximum levels and a chance.

Note that you can not add custom materials from other plugins in these settings, and you are probably not able to add custom enchantments from other plugins unless their author explicitly say they have made their system compatible.

As for the enchantment settings:

| Key        |       Values        | Default  |
|------------|:-------------------:|----------|
| `minLevel` | [Integer](#integer) | variable |
| `maxLevel` | [Integer](#integer) | variable |
| `chance`   |  [Chance](#chance)  | variable |

***

## minLevel

Sets the minimum enchantment level.

***

## maxLevel

Sets the maximum enchantment level.

***

## chance

Sets the chance of the enchantment happening. This is not using weighted probability, just a normal dice roll.

Note: replace `versionNumber` with the current version of the plugin.

# Events

**Note: Events are in com.magmaguy.betterstructures.api**

## BuildPlaceEvent

Called when a build is about to be placed. Exposes data about which build is going to be placed and where, among other things, through the FitAnything object.

**Don't attempt to modify the build getting placed!** You can modify minor things, but changing the whole build will probably result in a build with a poor fit.

This is cancellable.

## ChestFillEvent

Called when a chest is filled. Uses the container snapshot inventory to safely store the data to be applied.

Modifications to the loot should be done to the snapshot inventory through the add or remove item Spigot method.

This is cancellable.

# Key classes

## FitAnything

The FitAnything class is the class that gets instantiated when a build gets pasted in and handles every aspect of the paste, including filling chests and spawning mobs.

## WorldGuard

The WorldGuard class handles the WorldGuard region protections. The utility method `public static ProtectedRegion generateProtectedRegion(FitAnything fitAnything, String regionName)` is made available for developers to easily hook in a custom region protection scheme on top of BetterStructures.

# How to Use Commands
- Go to the commands page for help: [Commands Page]($language$/betterstructures/commands.md)

# Checking Where Structures Appear
- If you are a server admin and haven't turned off warnings, you'll be notified in chat when a structure appears.
- Click the chat message to teleport to the structure (not for Bedrock edition).
- Turn warnings on/off with `/betterstructures warn`.

# Why Structures May Not Appear
- Usually, structures don't appear in areas already explored. Visit new areas for structures.

<details> 
<summary>More Details</summary>

Structures won't appear in already explored areas to avoid filling them too much and damaging player buildings. BetterStructures knows if an area was explored before it was installed and won’t place structures there. If your world was fully explored before installing BetterStructures, you need to regenerate it or create a new world.

    - MobCombatSettings.yml: `doNaturalMobSpawning: false` disables natural elite spawns

## Adding an EliteMobs boss to your structure

- Add `[elitemobs]` to the first line of your sign
- Add the filename of the boss on the second / third / fourth lines of the sign like `test_boss.yml`
- More info [here]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md)

# BetterStructures with other plugins

## MythicMobs
- Spawn mythic mobs using signs with `[mythicmobs]` followed by the mob identifier on the other lines of the sign.
- EliteMobs is better for bosses with BetterStructures because I made both.

## MMOItems
- Add MMOItems with `mmoitems=<TYPE>@<ITEM-ID>` in the treasure configuration file.

## Custom Items from Other Plugins
- Use the lootify command to add any items to chests. See [Commands Page]($language$/betterstructures/commands.md).

# Creating Your Own Structures
- Learn how: [Structure Creation Guide]($language$/betterstructures/creating_structures.md)

# Performance Impact and Minimization
- Generating many structures can slow down your server.
- Use [Chunky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) to pre-generate your world and avoid performance issues.
- If not using EliteMobs, you can remove BetterStructures after world generation.
- With EliteMobs, keep BetterStructures for protected areas management, with minimal impact.


Welcome to the BetterStructures wiki!

This is Spigot Minecraft plugin aimed towards creating a generator-agnostic topology scanner capable of finding high compatibility spots based on geometry and block characteristics complimented with non-intrusive terrain adaptation methods.

Basically, it takes schematics, does a bunch of measurements and pastes them, often times adding pedestals and using special blocks to make sure the pastes look really good.

Read through the wiki to get an idea of what you can do for the plugin, or what it can do for you!

You are done! Structure will now begin spawning in ***new chunks***. *Chunks your server has already generated will not be able to get structures!*

# FAQ

Have a problem or question? Check the [FAQ]($language$/betterstructures/faq.md)!


The following is the full wiki of the elitemobs plugin!

As of EliteMobs 7.2, Elite Mobs use an advanced aggro system for damage dealt to Elites.

*Note: aggro is the name given to the mechanic that determines which player the boss targets for their attacks*

In the advanced aggro system, all Elites will target the highest damager among the group of players attacking them if there is more than one player attacking.

This means that simply kiting bosses around while another player kills them is impossible, and also means that high level players can't use lower level meat shields to take all the damage while they kill the boss.

If the damage is balanced among players, the boss will switch between targets fairly regularly, keeping all players on their toes.

This system is heavily used in our [Instanced Dungeons]($language$/elitemobs/instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md) where the players are expected to assume roles of Tanks and DPS. [Instanced Dungeons]($language$/elitemobs/instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md) will even have loot drops that were made specifically for Tank roles. These loot drops will have a special enchantment called [Loud Strikes]($language$/elitemobs/custom_enchantments_list.md&section=loud-strikes) that will draw aggro from any Elites that the player hits.

# Adventurer's Guild World

### What's the Adventure's Guild World?

The Adventurer's Guild World is the name of a premade world made for EliteMobs by Realm of Lotheridon.

![ag_pic_1.jpg](../../../img/wiki/ag_pic_1.jpg)

### What is the Adventurer's Guild World for?

The Adventurer's Guild World acts as a hub for EliteMobs. By hosting the hub, players no longer have to memorize any commands (other than /em) in order to interact with EliteMobs features.

In the world, the following NPCs are placed ahead of time:

- Transporter (for going back to your previous location)
- Guide (introductory quest to meet all NPC's)
- Guild Attendant (for upgrading [Guild Ranks]($language$/elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md&section=step-2:-discovering-the-economy))
- Dungeon Teleporters (special NPC's that will teleport players to any installed [Dungeons]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md))
- Barkeep (currently unimplemented)
- Quest Giver (for browsing and accepting randomly generated quests)
- Blacksmith (for buying procedurally generated items and selling drops from elite mobs)
- Special Blacksmith (for buying custom items and selling drops from elite mobs)
- Combat Instructor (for giving tips about EliteMobs combat)
- Wormholes (portals that will teleport players to [Dungeons]($language$elitemobs/dungeons.md) and any other installed content)
- Arena Master (this NPC will let players participate in the [Wood League Arena]($language$elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md&section=arenas))
- Story Mode Quests (let's players take quests for the [Story Mode Dungeons](www.magmaguy.com))
- Unbinder (let's players [Unbind]($language$/elitemobs/item_upgrade_system.md&section=unbinding-items) their EliteMobs loot for a price)
- Scrapper (let's players convert any unwanted loot to [Scrap]($language$/elitemobs/item_upgrade_system.md&section=scrapping-items))
- Repairman (players can interact with this NPC to [Repair]($language$/elitemobs/item_upgrade_system.md&section=repairing-elite-items) their items using scrap)
- Enchanter (let's players [Enchant]($language$/elitemobs/item_upgrade_system.md&section=enchanting-elite-items) their items)

Additionally, features an adventurer's guild building for the NPCs, as well as an EliteMobs Arena (currently unimplemented, coming soon!).

### How to set up the Adventurer's Guild World

To install the Adventurer's Guild World do the following:

1. Download the files. You can click on the red glass in `/em setup` to get links to the downloads.

2. Upload / move the files to your server's `/plugins/EliteMobs/imports` folder. Make sure you put the **ZIPPED** files inside the `imports` folder without modifying them in any way, EliteMobs will automatically extract the files and move them to the correct locations.

3. Restart or do `/em reload`. After a few seconds, when you do `/em setup` the indicators for the features you downloaded should be yellow.

4. Click on the yellow glass in the `/em setup` menu to install the imported features. If everything installed properly you should be in the Adventurer's Guild hub world. You can teleport to the Adventurer's Guild at any time by doing `/ag`.

#### Configuring The Wormhole

After installing the Adventurer's Guild hub world you will notice that there is a wormhole located where the players teleport in. This wormhole is supposed to be configured by you, to lead back to your regular world spawn or any other central location of your server.

To configure the wormhole, navigate to the directory *~plugins\EliteMobs\wormholes* and open *adventurers_guild_wormhole.yml*. Locate the `location2` value and replace `your_world_here` with the name of your world, followed by the correct coordinates where players should be teleported to.


The Announcement Priority System manages how important EliteMobs messages are. These are currently only used to manage the messages sent by Custom Boss spawns.

# Short-form cheat sheet:

*   Level 0: Silent / Local to players that fought the boss
*   Level 1: Chat Messages (if it has spawn messages)
*   Level 2: Tracking (if it has a location message)
*   Level 3: [Discord announcements (if it has spawn messages and DiscordSRV is installed & configured correctly)]($language$/elitemobs/discordsrv.md)

# How it works:

Note: You need to set your Custom Boss up with this priority system if you want to use a non-default value. Click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=announcementpriority) to learn how to do that.

## Level 0

Forces the Custom Boss to be silent. This means that no messages will be sent about it, even if it is configured to have them, with one exception: They will send death messages directly to players who damaged the boss.

## Level 1

**This is the default.** The Custom Boss will be able to send a message in chat if they are configured to do it. They will send spawn, death and  
escape messages if they are configured to have them.

## Level 2

The Custom Boss will have the same behavior as in Level 1, and will also be able to be tracked by players upon spawning if it has a location message associated to it. Players can click on chat to track it when it spawns, or they can use the /em menu to track it.

## Level 3

The Custom Boss have the same behavior as in Level 2, and will also send messages to the Discord room configured to send notifications about EliteMobs. [The page on how to set this feature up can be found here.]($language$/elitemobs/discordsrv.md) The messages on discord will be the same as the chat messages - spawn/death/escape

# Building for EliteMobs

The following wiki page helps you understand the process required to create EliteMobs dungeons and arenas.

Vocabulary:

- "Boss" - Big encounter, meant to be fought by a lot of people
- "Miniboss" - Smaller encounter, usually able to be killed by 1 player
- "Fodder" - Relatively easy mobs to kill

## Understanding the EliteMobs dungeon categories

### Lairs

Smallest size category

Lairs are usually 50x50 single-build structures, distributed as worlds, and usually contain one big boss encounter, though some can also contain a miniboss and some fodder.

### Minidungeons

Medium size category

Minidungeons are closer to 100x100 or 150x150 structures, often times with several structures or structures with several sections. These have 1 boss, and usually at least 3 or more minibosses. They also have lots of fodder.

### Adventures

Adventures are whole adventure maps, usually not measured in blocks. These are city-sized or even larger. They have 1 boss and 10+ minibosses, and dozens of unique fodder which usually amounts to hundreds or thousands in total in the map.

### Arenas

Arenas are wave-based survival arena challenges in EliteMobs. These are usually 100x100. They can have any amount of waves, but it's not usually recommended going over 50.

### Instanced Dungeons

Instanced Dungeons are similar to Minidungeons except that they are instanced. Meaning that every time a player or a group of players wishes to go to an Instanced Dungeon a new world is generated just for them.

Instanced Dungeons behave a lot like instanced dungeons that you might find in your favorite MMO. They usually have three difficulty levels with the rewards being better the harder the difficulty gets. They let players assume the roles of a Tank or DPS by equipping loot that is dropped within the instanced dungeon. Mobs will also use different sets of powers depending on what difficulty was picked when the players launched the instance. Any mobs that get slain in an instance will not respawn for the duration of that instance.

Any loot that is dropped within an instanced dungeon uses the greed or need system, meaning that the players can vote on the dropped item. As mentioned previously, instanced dungeon loot is specially made to be either defense oriented (tank) or offense oriented (DPS).

### Raids

Instanced content - coming soon

## Theming

The most important thing about any EliteMobs structure is the theme. Themes influence design of the build, its contents, its lore and its bosses.

As an example, you can see [The North Pole here](https://magmaguy.itch.io/elitemobs-the-north-pole). It had the concept of putting Christmas-related bosses in a snowglobe, resulting in a visually striking and mechanically interesting location.

Here is an other example, [The Oasis](https://magmaguy.itch.io/elitemobs-oasis). This was all about making an ancient Egypt location overrun with the undead and mummies, and it is one of the most popular builds in EliteMobs.

## Combat locations

Combat locations should avoid creating terrain which is easily exploitable. This means avoiding making pillars players can climb on to be safe, decorations that can be used to cheese the AI and other such obstacles. Some exploits are always going to be found, and that's not too important, but boss locations should be less prone to suffer from these exploits.

The ideal boss combat area is relatively flat, unobstructed, around 30 blocks in radius and can contain some pillars or other map elements which players must hide behind to clear certain boss mechanics.

Corridors should aim to be at least 5 blocks wide if they are meant to have adds in them. Miniboss arenas can be 15ish blocks in radius, depending on the powers/theming they have.

Please note that these are minimum dimensions. There's not really any problem if you go over.

Keep in mind that you can seal off or change the environment blocks either using [EliteScript]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_actions.md&section=place_block) or [Transitive Blocks]($language$elitemobs/creating_world_bosses.md&section=onspawnblockstates-and-onremoveblockstates). This is a great way to make sure players can only progress further once they have defeated a certain mob.

## Designing for EliteMobs

The better you know EliteMobs, the better the content you make for it will be. The following is a list of EliteMobs features which will help you come up with interesting things for your dungeon:

- [Regional Bosses]($language$/elitemobs/creating_world_bosses.md) - Every creature in Dungeons is a regional boss, meaning that they have a leash (if they go over a certain distance they get pulled back to their spawn point) and respawn on a timer.
- [Creating bosses]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md) This will show you everything a boss can do and be, like disguises, health multipliers, whether it can move and at what speed, taunts & more!
- [EliteScript]($language$/elitemobs/creating_powers.md) EliteScript is the most powerful tool at your disposal when it comes to creating unforgettable encounters where only your imagination is the limit.
- [Treasure Chests]($language$/elitemobs/creating_treasure_chests.md) These can have items or even turn into enemies
- [Boss phases]($language$/elitemobs/creating_boss_phases.md) - Bosses can have phases. This system is very powerful because bosses can turn into anything between phases, including different entity types, different disguises, different custom models and so on.
- [Transitive Blocks]($language$/elitemobs/creating_world_bosses.md&section=onspawnblockstates-and-onremoveblockstates) These are blocks that get placed when a boss spawns or dies. They also can be spawned and cleared when a boss changes phases! These can be used to be make very interesting dynamic arenas.
- [Wormholes]($language$/elitemobs/creating_wormholes.md) - cool portals that can teleport players to other locations.

## Encounter design

Encounter design should be a priority when designing the combat area. Ideally you would have an idea of which powers you want to use, or at least of what theme of the powers should be - something like fire, or lighting, or ice, or reinforcements, or anything else that fits with the EliteMobs powers. Once you know what you want the powers to be, you can design the combat area accordingly.

If the bosses have a power that required running away from them, the area needs to be big enough to accommodate that. If there is a power where you must hide behind an obstacle, the structure needs that kind of obstacle. There's a lot of details that can go into building these arenas, and the more you take into account the better the encounter will be.

<summary align="center"><b>Breakdown of the example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

Let us go over this example from the top and explain what this arena configuration does.

First the arena is enabled with `isEnabled`, and we can see that it is called Example Arena using the `arenaName` setting. The name will be shown when you interact with the arena NPC (we talk about how to make an arena NPC further down) that will allow players to join the arena. corner1 and corner2 define the arena size. These corners should be at the opposite sides of each other in the area that you plan to use for the arena.

`startLocation` is where the players will spawn in when joining the arena, in the example that would be in the center of the arena in the world my_arena_world. `exitLocation` is where the players will be teleported after they fail or finish the arena. In this case it would be the world my_minecraft_world and the coordinates in the example.

`waveCount` simply sets the amount of waves that the arena will last for. In this case that would be 5 waves. If they players manage to survive all 5 waves they have managed to survive the arena. `delayBetweenWaves` will set the amount of seconds before the next wave starts. In our example players would have 5 seconds to prepare before the next wave starts.

`spawnPoints` set the locations where we can have our mobs spawn. We can make as many as we want and name them as we want. In the example we have decided to make 5 spawn points and name them north, south, center, east and west.

`bossList` is where we define which boss should spawn at what wave and at which location. In the example wave 1 will have 3 bosses spawning from the spawn locations that we named north, center and south. All three are set to use the same boss file but we could have used different boss files for each one.

`rawArenaReward` sets the rewards that will be handed out after a player manages to survive/beat a wave. As we can see in the example beating wave 1 will reward the player with 5 elite coins. If they manage to survive the rest of the waves and then beat wave 5, they will be rewarded with 25 elite coins and a 50% chance to get a level 5 MagmaGuy's Toothpick.

`minimumPlayerCount` sets the minimum required amount of players needed before the arena will start. In our example this setting is set to 1, so only one player is needed for the arena to starts. `maximumPlayerCount` sets the maximum amount of players that can participate in the arena. In our example this setting is set to 3, meaning that if more than 3 players try to participate in the arena then the arena will not start until there are 3 players or less.

`arenaMessages` lets you add some flavor text that will be displayed in the chat at the start of the defined waves. In our example we have decided to display a short message at the start of each wave. We have also decided to include the NPC name at the start of each message giving the illusion that the text is spoken dialogue by the announcer (arena master).

`cylindricalArena` this setting will let us toggle if the defined area that we have set with `corner1` and `corner2` should be a cylindrical shape instead of a cuboid one. In our example we have set this to `false` meaning that the example arena is a cuboid shape.

`permission` lets us set a permission that the players will need to have to be able to join/start the arena. In our example the players will need the `arena.mypermission` permission to be able to use the arena.

# Creating custom bosses

# Before you begin

## Where do boss files go?

Boss files go into the configuration folder `~/plugins/EliteMobs/custombosses`.

It is possible to create subfolders, such as `~/plugins/EliteMobs/custombosses/mybosses`. This is recommended to keep things organized.

One file defines one boss, though it is possible to spawn the same boss several times and even set several spawn locations for the same boss file.

It is possible to use the [webapp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html) to quickly and easily create custom bosses and more.

## Smallest possible configuration

**The smallest possible configuration file for a Custom Boss is:**
```yml
```

Note how this is just an empty file. This will still spawn a zombie custom boss with a custom name, as those are the defaults. **Everything in this page is optional!**

## Example boss

<div align="center">

Let's take a look at an example of what a boss file looks like.

### helmet/chestplate/leggings/boots/mainhand/offhand

Sets the armor of the boss. Not all minecraft models are able to show armor. Boss armor is purely cosmetic and does not affect gameplay.

| Key |                                    Values                                     | Default |
|-|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-|
| `helmet` |           [Material](#material), [UUID](https://minecraftuuid.com/)           | none |
| `chestplate` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `leggings` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `boots` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `mainHand` | [Material](#material) | none |
| `offHand` | [Material](#material) | none |

**Note:** This field also lets you set custom models for items. To set the custom model ID, add the ID after the material type following this format: `ITEM_MATERIAL:ID`. Example: `DIAMOND_SWORD:1` sets the boss to wear a diamond sword with the custom model #1 in your texture pack.

**Note 2:** This field also lets you set custom leather colors with the format `ITEM_MATERIAL:CODE` where the code is the hexadecimal representation of the color. Example: `LEATHER_LEGGINGS:ffa500` would create orange leggings. You can use hex codes, just remove the `#` from the hex code. You can get hex codes from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).

**Note 3:** The helmet field also lets you set mob helmets to be player heads. Simply get the UUID of the player head you would like to use and type it into the helmet field. *The player needs to be online for this to work or the head will default to a generic MineCraft head.* You can get player UUID's from [here](https://minecraftuuid.com/).

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
helmet: 198c4123-cafc-45df-ba79-02a421eb8ce7
chestplate: DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE:1
leggings: LEATHER_LEGGINGS:ffa500

***

| Key | Values | Default |

Here is a list of what the priorities do:

| Value |                                                                            Description                                                                            |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml

**Note**: You will have to configure the spawnMessage, deathMessage/deathMessages, escapeMessage for chat and discord announcements and the locationMessage for the tracking feature if you wish to use the corresponding Announcement Priority level.

***

### followDistance

Set the distance at which bosses aggro and enter combat.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `followDistance` | [Double](#double) | none, uses defaults from Minecraft |

Note 1: Regional bosses have half the `followDistance` when out of combat. This is so they don't aggro from too far away, which can cause annoying combat issues due to leash constraints.

Note 2: The higher the `followDistance`, the more intensive on the server CPU the boss becomes. Use carefully and responsibly!

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
followDistance: 30
```

</div>

Sets a range of 30 blocks where if a player gets within that distance near the boss it will start chasing/attacking the player.

</details>

***

### onDeathCommands

Sets the list of commands to run on custom boss death.

| Key |        Values        | Default |

The list supports the following placeholders:

| Value | Description |
|-|:-:|
| `$level` | Placeholder for the boss level. |
| `$name` | Placeholder for the boss name. |
| `$chance=x$` | Makes a command have a chance to run. |
| `$players` | Makes the command run once for every player in the damagers list and replaces each time with the username of a different player on that list. |
| `$locationX` | X coordinate of the boss at the time of death. |
| `$locationY` | Y coordinate of the boss at the time of death. |
| `$locationZ` | Z coordinate of the boss at the time of death. |
| `$damager1name` | Username of the top damager |
| `$damager2name` | Username of the second top damager |
| `$damager3name` | Username of the third top damager |

Take a look at the example below to get a better understanding of how these work.

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
onDeathCommands:
- "say $players has killed $name! That was level $level!"
- "$chance=0.5$ say What a kill!"
```

<div align="center">

![create_boss_mounted.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_boss_ondeathcommands.jpg)

</div>

</div>

If Player1, Player2 and Player3 all damaged the boss before killing it, this is what the command output will be from console:

<div align="left">

```
say Player1 has killed CustomBossName! That was level X!
say Player2 has killed CustomBossName! That was level X!
say Player3 has killed CustomBossName! That was level X!

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

This will play the song ice_queen.idle for 76370 ticks and then loop it. Note that the location of the song is determined by the resource pack.

Here is the second way of setting up songs:

<div align="left">

```yml
song: name=elitemobs:ice_queen.end_transition length=14328->name=elitemobs:ice_queen.end_loop length=28657
```

This will play the song ice_queen.end_transition for 14328 ticks and then transition to ice_queen.end_loop for 28657 ticks and loop the end_loop.

This allows bosses to have an "intro" or "transition" song and then a main track that loops.

## Boss phases

<div align="center">

Bosses can have phases that change when the boss reaches a certain percentage of health. When this happens, the boss starts using a different configuration file, meaning that everything about the boss can change, including things like the entity type.
</br>To learn more about boss phases click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_boss_phases.md).


| Key | Description | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|-|
| `phases` | Sets the phases that the boss will have. Mandatory | [List](#string_list) | none |
| `phaseSpawnLocation` | Sets where the phase boss spawns. Optional | [String](#string) | none |


<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

For this example, we are going to show three different configuration files.

First boss configuration file: phase_1_boss.yml

```yml
name: "Phase 1"
entityType: ZOMBIE
phases:
- phase_2_boss.yml:0.60
- phase_3_boss.yml:0.30
```

Second boss configuration file: phase_2_boss.yml

```yml
name: "Phase 2"
entityType: SKELETON
```

Third boss configuration file: phase_3_boss.yml

```yml
name: "Phase 3"
phaseSpawnLocation: same_as_boss,10,64,100,0,0
entityType: RAVAGER
```

</div>

This boss would change to the configuration file `phase_2_boss.yml` at 60% health, and to the configuration file `phase_3_boss.yml` at 30% health in the same world as phase 2 and at coordinates x=10, y=64 and z=100. The entity type and name of the boss would also change.

The format for an entry is `filename:healthPercentage`.

phaseSpawnLocation is optional, if it is not set the boss will change phases where it's standing.

</details>

The following things are important to know when designing a phase boss:

<div align="left">

- The configuration file for the first phase sets all phases of the boss.
- Threat / damage counted is kept between phases for players.
- Switching phases is based on the percentage of health lost, which is preserved when switching to a different phase. This means increasing or decreasing the healthMultiplier between phases will not heal or damage the boss, it will still switch with the same percentage, but will have more or less health for that phase.
- Phase bosses revert to phase 1 if they go out of combat.
- Phase bosses which are also regional bosses share the same leash radius and timeout mechanic across all phases, and will respawn as the phase 1 boss when the timer is finished.
- The configuration file for the last phase sets the loot for the boss.
- Phases can not be skipped - overkill damage will still make the boss switch phases at the percentage defined.
- Phase bosses that have mounts cease to be mounted when switching phases.

</div>

</div>

</div>

***

## Regional bosses

<div align="center">

Regional bosses are a specific type of Custom Bosses that spawn at a specific configured location and are able to respawn at that location after a delay. Additionally, they can have leashes that make sure they stay in a specific zone, among other features.

These are used for all of the dungeon content. To learn more about regional bosses click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_world_bosses.md).

| Key | Description | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|:-:|-|
| `isRegionalBoss` | Sets if the boss is regional. Should be true if you want a regional boss.  | `true` /  `false` | `false` |
| `spawnLocation` | Sets the spawn locations of the boss.  | Add these through the `/em addSpawnLocation [filename.yml]` command! | none |
| `spawnCooldown` | Sets the respawn cooldown of the boss, in <b>minutes</b>. | [Integer](#integer) | `0` |
| `leashRadius` | Sets the distance the boss can go from its spawn point before getting pulled back. | [Double](#double) | none |
| `onSpawnBlockStates` | Sets the blocks the boss will modify when it spawns. | Check commands below | none |
| `onRemoveBlockStates` | Sets the blocks the boss will modify when it despawns. | Check commands below | none |

As indicated, Regional Bosses can have `onSpawnBlockStates` and `onRemoveBlockStates`.

This is a very useful feature for modifying combat arenas during combat, especially when combined with phase switches, as it becomes possible to open and close combat arenas through changing block states.

The format for these is too complex to write manually, so a few commands exist to help you set them up:

| Command | Description |
|-|:-:|
| /em registerblocks [regional_boss_file.yml] [on_spawn/on_remove] | Starts registering manual block selections for on spawn or on remove block states. |
| /em registerblocksedit [regional_boss_file.yml] [on_spawn/on_remove] | Edits the on spawn or on remove block states. |
| /em registerblocksarea [regional_boss_file.yml] [on_spawn/on_remove] | Allows admins to select large areas of blocks to save as states. |
| /em registerblocksareaedit [regional_boss_file.yml] [on_spawn/on_remove] | Allows admins to edit large areas of blocks to save as states. |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example use:</b></summary>

<div align="left">

Let's say you want to make a fight where a boss spawns in an arena that has an open door, and you want to make it so the door closes when the fight starts and reopens when the fight is over.

To do this, you will need two boss phases and to register three different sets of block states. For this example, I will name these phases phase_1_boss.yml and phase_2_boss.yml respectively.

1) Use `/em registerblocks phase_1_boss.yml on_spawn` or `/em registerblocksedit phase_1_boss.yml on_spawn` to register the door blocks in their open state.

This means registering the air blocks. Area selection is recommended here.

This is necessary to make sure that the door is open when the boss spawns so players are guaranteed to have a way in.

2) Use `/em registerblocks phase_2_boss.yml on_spawn` or `/em registerblocksedit phase_2_boss.yml on_spawn` to register the door blocks in their closed state.

This means registering the solid blocks of the door that would prevent the player from leaving.

This is necessary to change the door to be solid when the boss enters phase 2, preventing players from leaving.

3) Use `/em registerblocks phase_2_boss.yml on_remove` or `/em registerblocksedit phase_2_boss.yml on_remove` to register the door blocks in their open state.

This means registering the same blocks from the first step again (the air blocks).

This is necessary to open the door when the boss dies, allowing players to leave the arena.

### alert

<div align="center">

Sets whether the boss is alert. By default, Regional Bosses are slowed and have a shorter aggro distance when they are out of combat. This setting prevents Regional Bosses from being slowed and having a shorter aggro distance while outside of combat, so they will always behave the same way in or out of combat.

</div>

### removeAfterDeath

<div align="center">

Sets whether the Regional Boss will be permanently deleted after being killed. This is what BetterStructures uses for Shrines, where the Regional Boss is only designed to be fought against once and then never again at that location. 

</div>

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|

# Creating Boss Phases


Boss Phases are a sub-mechanic of Custom Bosses. The system behind these phases is so flexible and powerful that it requires its own dedicated explanation in order to make sure that you make good use of this feature.

### How do Boss Phases work?

Boss Phases can be added to any Custom Boss in EliteMobs using the following config format:

```yaml
phases:
- phase_2_boss.yml:0.X
- phase_3_boss.yml:0.Y
```

_**Note: the boss you originally spawn which contains the info for all other phases will be referred to as the phase 1 boss. It should not be in the phases entry.**_

The basic intent behind this mechanic is to allow admins to change Custom Boss attributes during combat. By using the config format above, you are able to completely change configuration files from phase to phase, meaning that you can change 99.99% of attributes - like powers, damage multipliers, health multipliers, entity type, disguise, armor worn...

In order to achieve this, EliteMobs deletes your boss during combat and instantly replaces it with the version from the next phase. The process behind this is instant, so it tends to be pretty seamless - unless you want to make it flashy on purpose.

### Example

Take this example phase boss:

File: phase_1_boss.yml

```yaml
isEnabled: true
level: 50
healthMultiplier: 10
entityType: STRAY
powers:
- attack_gravity.yml
phases:
- phase_2_boss.yml:0.60
- phase_3_boss.yml:0.30
```

File: phase_2_boss.yml

```yaml
isEnabled: true
level: 50
healthMultiplier: 10
entityType: SKELETON
powers:
- attack_gravity.yml
- arrow_fireworks.yml
```

File: phase_3_boss.yml

```yaml
isEnabled: true
level: 50
healthMultiplier: 10
entityType: WITHER_SKELETON
powers:
- arrow_rain
```

This constitutes a valid Phase Boss. If you spawn phase_1_boss.yml, it will spawn a Stray with the attributes listed above. After being damaged down to _60%_ of its health, it will immediately be replaced in the same location by the Custom Boss as formed in phase_2_boss.yml, since the configuration file states `- phase_2_boss.yml:0.60` (_phase_2_boss.yml is the file name for that custom boss, 0.60 is 60% health_). _Note that the phase 2 boss will spawn with 60% of its health, since that's when it changes to that phase._ The boss will have the powers listed on the phase_2_boss.yml file. Once the phase 2 boss is damaged down to 30% of its health, it spawns the boss set for phase 3. Note that the powers for phase 3 are unrelated to the ones from before - you can completely change powers between phases, just like nearly all other attributes.

## Advanced

### Inherited mechanics

Here's a list of things that do not change from phase to phase:

- The first Phase Boss in the chain determines which phases the boss will go through, meaning that you shouldn't put a phases entry for the other bosses in the phase.

- Threat table / Damage table stays the same, meaning loot distribution and the advanced aggro system are unaffected by a phase change

- Switching phases is based on % of health lost, which is preserved from phase to phase. This means that if your boss is set to enter phase 2 at 50% health, the boss that will appear to replace the phase 1 boss will still be at 50% health. This also means each phase can have completely different amounts of health without it causing issues.

- Phase Bosses revert to Phase 1 if they are healed back to full health via the default out of combat boss regen system

- Phase Bosses which are also Regional Bosses share the same leash radius and timeout mechanic across all phases, and will respawn as the phase 1 boss after the respawn timer is finished.


#### Warnings

Here's a list of mechanics that work in a way that may initially be counter-intuitive:

- If a Phase Boss gets killed during any phase, it will drop the loot from that phase. This means that if someone manages to kill a phase boss too quickly (1-shot), it will actually die and drop the loot that is configured for that boss file, which may not necessarily be the final phase. You can fix this by setting the loot table to be the same across all the boss files for this phase boss, or by making sure that your Phase Bosses have enough HP to the point where it is impossible to kill them in just a few hits. Alternatively, you can have special loot tables for people able to skip phases.

- Since Phase Bosses actually cause Custom Bosses to spawn during combat, they will do their entire spawning routine when they spawn. As such, be careful when it comes to spawn messages and commands that run on spawn. Additionally, phase bosses do not die if they change phases, they are simply swapped with something else. This means that commands that run on death will only run for the last Phase Boss, or if the player manages to skip a phase by dealing enough damage. Commands that run on spawn can be used to hook into phase changes. \*Note: \* the spawn message will not be sent again for the phase 1 boss if they respawn due to the phase boss being regenerated back to full health.

- Phase bosses can come mounted or cease to be mounted between phases. If the phase boss is killed before the mount is dead, the mount will persist through to the next phase. If the boss regenerates back to full, the mount is deleted and the boss becomes unmounted, unless it is configured to mount an entity during phase 1.

- Since new Custom Bosses are spawned between phases, the 1-time spawn mechanic resets between phases and on full heals.


### Tips & tricks

- You can use the fact that equipment and entity types can be changed throughout combat to make the boss look more and more (or less and less) dangerous throughout the fight

- While possible, unless there is a specific design goal in mind, it is probably best that the powers the Phase Boss has don't change too drastically between phases, as players are more likely to enjoy a progression that feels natural throughout the fight.

- You can use onSpawn commands to run commands between phases

- Phases can be used to switch the boss from melee to ranged mode and vice-versa

- Phase Bosses were built to be tough bosses with lots of HP. They are usually best served as final boss encounter for dungeons or as big World Bosses.

- When designing encounters, keep in mind that it is possible reinforcements will not be killed by players between phases.

- Bosses can have any number of phases you want, but the more phases they have, the more health they will need to make each phase matter.

# Creating EliteMobs content

Making content for EliteMobs is easy and can be done in just a few minutes!

You will find in the sidebar links to create all kind of content, from bosses, to events, to entire dungeons!

## Before you start

You can make all the content through the [webapp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html), which makes the process much faster.

All configuration files use the yml/yaml file format. This is the normal file format for Minecraft configuration files.

YML is basically a text file that follows specific formatting rules for specific data. If you plan to create a lot of EliteMobs content, and are just getting started, you may want to check [this page]($langage$/global/configuration_file_guide.md) which shows how the text files should be written to be in a valid yml format.

[![webapp_banner.jpg](../../../img/wiki/webapp_banner.jpg)](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html)

This guide is for EliteMobs 7.3.4 and later

# What are Custom Events?

Custom Events here refer to events that occur randomly in-game, whether based on player actions or having a timed trigger. The plugin comes preloaded with a number of Custom Events, such as the Balrog event, the Kraken event and the Treasure Goblin events, to name a few.

This system is called **Custom** Events because the events can not only be customized but created from scratch. What follows is a guide on how to create and customize your own events.

# Creating Custom Items

## What are Custom Items?

Custom Items are items as defined by EliteMobs through configuration files. You can customize several aspects about these items, such as the level of the item, the enchantments, name, lore, texture and more!

## Webapp

You can easily and quickly create Custom Loot [here](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html)!

## Before you begin

### Where do Custom Items go?

Custom item files go into the configuration folder `~/plugins/EliteMobs/customitems`

It is possible to create subfolders, such as `~/plugins/EliteMobs/customitems/myitems`. THis is recommended to keep things organized.

Files are stored in the `.yml` file format and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is the recommended file editing software for configuration work. One file defines one boss, though it is possible to spawn the same boss several times and even set several spawn locations for the same boss file.

It is possible to use the [webapp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html) to quickly and easily create custom bosses and more.

<div align="center">

### Smallest possible configuration

**Please note that the smallest possible configuration file for a Custom Item is:**

```yml
```

Note how this is just an empty file. This will default to using a wooden sword called "Default name". **Everything in this page is optional!**

### Example item

Let's take a look at an example of what an item file looks like.

<details> 
<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
isEnabled: true
material: WOODEN_AXE
name: '&4Test item'
lore:
- This is a cool item
- It has cool lore
enchantments:
- DAMAGE_ALL,4
- FLAMETHROWER,1
potionEffects:
- FAST_DIGGING,0,self,onHit
- POISON,0,target,onHit
- GLOWING,0,self,continuous
dropWeight: dynamic
scalability: scalable
itemType: custom
```

</div>

</details>

</div>

##  Custom Item settings

The following is a list of all the things you can configure for custom items:

<div align="center">

***

### isEnabled

Sets if the item is enabled. Does not affect items that have already been generated.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `isEnabled` | `true` / `false` | `true` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
isEnabled: true
```

</div>

</details>

***

### material

Sets the item material.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `material` | [Pick from this list!](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html) | `WOODEN_SWORD` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
material: DIAMOND_SWORD
```

</div>

</details>


***

### level

Sets the item level.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `level` | [Integer](#integer) | `0` |

Note that this setting isn't relevant if you set the item [`scalability`](#scalability) to be `scalable`. If you set it to be `limited, this will be the highest possible level of the item.

Also, materials have a minimum level. Iron materials are level 6, diamond materials are level 7. You can't force items to be lower level than the material's level.

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
level: 100
```

</div>

</details>


***

### name

Sets the display name of the item.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `material` | [String](#string) with [color codes](#color-codes) | "Default name" |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
name: "&2Cool item"
```

<div align="center">

![create_item_name.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_item_name.jpg)

</div>

</div>

</details>

***

### lore

Sets the lore of the item.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `lore` | [List](#list) with [color codes](#color-codes) | none |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
lore:
- "&2This is the coolest sword"
- "&2of all time!"
```

<div align="center">

![create_item_lore.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_item_lore.jpg)

</div>

</div>

</details>

***

### enchantments

Sets the enchantments on the item.

| Key |                                                                                                       Values                                                                                                        | Default |
|-|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-|
| `enchantments` | [List](#list) with [Minecraft enchantments](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html) or [EliteMobs Custom Enchantments]($language$/elitemobs/custom_enchantments_list.md) | none |

Note that these entries follow the format `enchantmentName:enchantmentLevel`. Check the example below!

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
enchantments: 
- "DAMAGE_UNDEAD,8"
- "DURABILITY,4"
- "DAMAGE_ALL,7"
- "LOUD_STRIKES,3"
```

<div align="center">

![create_item_enchantments.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_item_enchantments.jpg)

</div>

</div>

</details>

Also note that enchantments like sharpness become elite sharpness by default if the level start going over vanilla Minecraft limits.

***

### potionEffects

Sets the potion effects the item will have. These can be applied to the player or to an entity damaged by the player.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `potionEffects` | [List](#list) with [Minecraft potion effects](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html)| none |

Furthermore, potion effects use a specific format that allows admins to select who gets affected and when:

| Setting | Description | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|:-:|-|
| Potion effect level | Sets the level of the potion effect. **Potion effects start at level 0**!  | [Integer](#integer) | none |
| Affected entity | Sets who gets affected by the potion effect.  | `self` (the player) / `target` (entity that gets hit) | none |
| Application method | Sets when the potion effect gets applied.  | `onHit` / `continuous` (constantly reapplies) | none |

The format for potion effects is `potionEffectName,potionEffectLevel,affectedEntity,applicationMethod`. Check the example below!

EliteMobs also features custom items that function as charms. These items do nothing else but provide potion effects to the player when the item is being held or is equipped in a slot.

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
potionEffects: 
- "POISON,0,target,onHit"
- "HEAL,1,self,onHit"
- "NIGHT_VISION,0,self,continuous"
```

<div align="center">

![create_item_potion_effects.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_item_potion_effects.jpg)

</div>

</div>

With this set of potion effects, the following things will happen:

On hit, the poison potion effect (level 1) will be applied to the entity that got hit by the player. Additionally, the player will be affected by a level 2 instant heal potion effect.

Continuously, the player will be given night vision. This means that the player will have night vision for as long as they are wearing or holding the item.

</details>

***

### scalability

Sets how the level of the item grows with the level of the boss that drops it.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `scalability` | `fixed`, `limited` or `scalable`. Check below! | scalable |

Check this list to understand what the different options do!

| Setting | Description |
|-|:-:|
| `fixed` | The item level will always be the level set in the configuration file. |
| `limited` | The max item level will be limited by the one set in the configuration file or the level of the boss, whichever is lowest. |
| `scalable` | The level of the item will be entirely based on the level of the boss that drops it. |

Note that items with a dropWeight will always have a `fixed` scalability.

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
scalability: "scalable"
```

</div>

</details>

***

### itemType

Sets where you can obtain the item from.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `itemType` | `custom` or `unique`. Check below! | `custom` |

There are two item types:

| Setting | Description |
|-|:-:|
| `custom` | The item will be able to drop from any EliteMobs mob able to drop loot, and will be in the custom shop. `
| `unique` | The item will not be dropped by any boss and will not be in the custom shop. The only way to obtain it is by configuring a Custom Boss to drop it through its `uniqueLootTable`! |

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
itemType: "unique"
```

</div>

</details>

***

### dropWeight

Sets the loot table the item will fit into.

| Key |                  Values                  | Default |
|-|:----------------------------------------:|-|
| `dropWeight` | `dynamic` or an [Double](#double) value. | `dynamic` |

EliteMobs has 5 different loot tables for custom items, excluding the ones configured directly like the `uniqueLootList` on Custom Bosses.

These are as follows:

| Loot table | Description | Default weight |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Procedurally generated items | Items that are randomly generated based on server configuration files | `90.0` |
| Weighed items | Items that have a weight other than `dynamic` | `1.0` |
| Fixed items | Items that have a fixed scalability | `10.0` |
| Limited items | Items that have limited scalability | `3.0` |
| Scalable items | Items that are scalable | `6.0` |

When a boss dies, one item from these tables is selected based on the ItemSettings.yml configuration file. The defaults for the weights are listed above in `Default weight`. The higher the weight, the more likely an item is to drop.

`Weighed items` have a small `Default weight`, meaning they will not drop very often. Items with a `dropWeight` that is not `dynamic` are meant to be rare and are only used in the defaults for the charms bosses drop - items not used directly for combat, but rather for buffing players with potion effects.

The `dropWeight` you set here sets the chance of a specific `Weighed item` dropping from the list of `Weighed items`. It does not increase the chance of `Weighed item`s dropping.

**If you are confused and just want to make weapons and armor, skip this setting as it correctly defaults to be `dynamic`.**

`Weighed item`s usually have a weight of 1.0.

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
dropWeight: "dynamic"
```

</div>

</details>


***

### customModelID

Sets the texture of the item. Requires using a valid texture from the resource pack!

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `customModelID` | [Integer](#integer) | none |

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
material: DIAMOND_SWORD
customModelID: 1
```

</div>

This will use the custom texture 1 of diamonds swords from the resource pack the player is using. It is recommended you set your server up to give players resource packs on login if you want to use this feature correctly.

</details>

***

### permission

Sets the permission required in order to obtain the item.

| Key | Values | Default |
|-|:-:|-|
| `permission` | [String](#string) | none |

You will need a permission management plugin to give players permissions. This will only work correctly if you have not disabled the soulbind enchantment.

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
permission: "elitemobs.cool.permission"
```

</div>

With this setup, only players with the permission `elitemobs.cool.permission` will be able to obtain this item.

</details>

***

### soulbound

Sets if the item should be soulbound on drop.

| Key |       Values        | Default |
|-|:-------------------:|---------|
| `soulbound` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `true`  |

# EliteMobs Scripting system

The following page covers how to Create Elite Scripts!

This is an advanced feature and requires some in-depth knowledge of EliteMobs.

**Note: Elite Scripts can be added as power files or to custom boss files!** If used as power files, you can add them as normal powers to bosses using the [powers]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=powers) configuration setting of Custom Bosses, as per usual.

## Adding an EliteScript

To start adding an EliteScript to a boss, add the following entry to the boss file:

```yml
eliteScript:
```

**Note: The following is extremely case and space sensitive! Make sure your spaces, line breaks and overall formatting matches the examples!**

Now that you have your script start declared, you can add your specific script. For this example, we're going to create a script called `Example`:

```yml
eliteScript:
  Example:
```

EliteScripts have 5 different sections: `Events`, `Conditions`, `Zones`, `Actions` and `Cooldowns`. Only `Actions` are mandatory.

Let's take a look at a simple example:

```yml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: PUSH
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
      vValue: 0,0.5,0
    Cooldowns:
      local: 60
      global: 20
```

This script makes an elite get pushed up when hit by a player, and will not do so again for 3 seconds (and will stop other powers from triggering for 1 second due to the settings we have set in the Cooldowns section).

Now that you know the general format of how scripts are structured, it's time to learn what you can do with each section!

## Adding multiple EliteScripts

You can have multiple actions on an event, but what if you want multiple scripts on the same boss? This is as simple as creating a new script entry! Let us expand on the previous example and add another script to it:

```yml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: PUSH
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
      vValue: 0,0.5,0
    Cooldowns:
      local: 60
      global: 20
  Example2:
    Events:
    - PlayerDamagedByEliteMobEvent
    Actions:
    - action: SET_ON_FIRE
      Target:
        targetType: DIRECT_TARGET
    Cooldowns:
      local: 200
      global: 60
```
In this example we have added a second script called Example2. Example2 will set-on-fire the player that gets damaged by the boss, this is due to the targetType being set to [DIRECT_TARGET]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md&section=target-types). </br>The cooldown for this script is set to 200 ticks meaning that the boss will only be able to set-on-fire players every 10 seconds.

## Making standalone powers

Standalone powers are almost entirely composed by the Elite Script. There are only two fields that are optional. Do not forget that for the standalone powers to work they must be placed in the `~plugins/EliteMobs/powers` folder. </br>Standalone power example:

```yml
isEnabled: true
powerType: UNIQUE
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: PUSH
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
      vValue: 0,.3,0
    Cooldowns:
      local: 60
      global: 20
```

### isEnabled

Same with everywhere else in the plugin, sets if the power is enabled.

### powerType

Power type sets how the power gets assigned. The values are:

- `UNIQUE`: The power will only be applied to custom bosses that have the power set in the powers section.
- `DEFENSIVE` / `MISCELLANEOUS` / `OFFENSIVE`: ANY elite will be able to get these powers, and they will count to a specific subset of powers.
- `MAJOR_ZOMBIE`, `MAJOR_SKELETON`, `MAJOR_BLAZE`, `MAJOR_ENDERMAN`, `MAJOR_GHAST`: Only elites of the adequate entity type will be able to spawn naturally with these powers, and they will count towards major powers.

# Example Quest

EliteMobs comes prepackaged with a `test_quest.yml`, which will be analyzed here as a simple quest format to follow.

_Custom Quests are in the `~plugins/EliteMobs/customquests` folder!_

`test_quest.yml`

```yaml
isEnabled: true
customObjectives:
  Objective1:
    amount: '1'
    filename: test_boss.yml
    objectiveType: KILL_CUSTOM
customRewards:
- filename=magmaguys_toothpick.yml:amount=1:chance=1
name: "&aKill the Test Boss"
questLore: 
- "&cEnd the test boss'' reign of terror!"
```

<div align="center">

![create_quest_quest.jpg](../../../img/wiki/create_quest_quest.jpg)

</div>

*If your quest UI does not look like this you can change it to match using `/em alt`.*

This example quest will give players the task of slaying 1 test_boss.yml. (The actual name of the boss displayed in the quest tracker will be the `name:` set in test_boss.yml.) And as a reward for completing the quest they will be rewarded with 1 Magmaguy's Toothpick.

### Permissions

As mentioned in the tables above, permissions are usually [Strings](#string) or [String Lists](#string_list). But let us go into more detail how you will be using these to lock and unlock quests. 

Let us say that you are making quest_3 in a series of quests that you have planned and you do not want players to be able to take quest_3 before they finish quest_2. We would configure the quest file like this:

```yml
questAcceptPermission: elitequest.quest_2.yml
questLockoutPermission: elitequest.quest_3.yml
```
By setting the `questAcceptPermissions` to `elitequest.quest_2.yml` we have now prevented players from taking quest_3.yml before they finish quest_2.yml. </br> By setting `questLockoutPermission` to `elitequest.quest_3.yml` we have prevented players from being able to receive that quest as long as they already have that quest in their tracker or if they already finished that quest. This stops players from being able to repeat the quest.

Should you want to make a quest that only becomes available after the players have completed a series of quests, then you would configure the quest file like this:

```yml
questAcceptPermissions: 
- elitequest.quest_2.yml
- elitequest.quest_3.yml
- elitequest.quest_4.yml
```

If you want players to only be able to loot certain items when they have the correct quest active, then we can do that by using `temporaryPermissions`. We would make a permission in the quest file using `temporaryPermissions` then make a matching [permission]($language$/elitemobs/creating_items.md&section=permission) in the item file using `permission`.

For example we would open up our quest file and add the following:

```yml
temporaryPermissions: 
- elitequest.my_cool_item.yml
```
Then we would open up the item file, in our case *my_cool_item.yml* and then add the following:

```yml
permission: elitequest.my_cool_item.yml
```
Both files have now matching permissions which should now make our item only drop when the players have the correct quest active.

# Creating Custom Reinforcements

If you are interested in summoning elites during combat to reinforce the a boss, this guide covers that in detail.

## Steps to create a custom boss:

1. Create your main custom boss that will summon your custom boss
2. Create a custom boss for reinforcements. Keep in mind that custom bosses can be stronger than vanilla mobs, but they can also be weaker.
3. Add the correct reinforcement line to the configuration file

## Creating the reinforcement line

Let's assume you have a custom boss with this format:

```yaml
isEnabled: true
entityType: ENDER_DRAGON
name: $eventBossLevel &eBinder of Worlds
level: 200
powers:
- ender_dragon_arrow_bombardment.yml
```

And you want to add reinforcements to it. Here is what one such reinforcement could look like:

```yaml
- summonType:ON_COMBAT_ENTER
  filename: binder_of_worlds_phase_1_parkour_reinforcement.yml
```

And to make it valid, add it to the powers list:

```yaml
isEnabled: true
entityType: ENDER_DRAGON
name: $eventBossLevel &eBinder of Worlds
level: 200
powers:
- ender_dragon_arrow_bombardment.yml
- summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER
  filename: binder_of_worlds_phase_1_parkour_reinforcement.yml
```

The reinforcement is now added to the boss entity. However, as you can see, there are several options here you can customize. Let's cover them.

## All Custom Reinforcement options

*Tip: You can also use EliteScript to summon reinforcements, more about that [here]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_actions.md&section=summon_reinforcement).*

<div align="center">

### summonType

This is a mandatory field. It sets when the reinforcement should spawn.

| Key    |   Values    | Default  |
|--------|:-----------:|:--------:|
| `summonType` | Special [1] | `ON_HIT` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
summonType: ON_HIT
```

</div>

</details>

#### Special [1]

| Key | Description                                                                                       |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  `ONCE`   | Spawns the reinforcement once, the first time the boss is hit. (can rely on a % chance to happen) |
| `ON_HIT`  | Spawn the reinforcement any time the boss gets hit (can rely on a % chance to happen)             |
| `ON_COMBAT_ENTER`    | Spawn the reinforcement when the boss enters combat (1)                                                                                                  |
| `ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL`    |  Special: this is specifically for placing down end crystals for dragon fights when the boss enters combat(1)                                                                                                 |
| `GLOBAL`    |  Spawns reinforcements for every player in the same world as the boss. The reinforcements will spawn near the players, no matter how far they are from the boss. This requires the `customSpawn` field to be set to work!                                                                                                 |

_(1) Bosses enter combat either when they get hit by players or when they detect a player within range._

***

### filename

This is a mandatory field as it sets which reinforcement should spawn. The only exception to making this field mandatory is when using the `summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL` setting, as end crystals aren't elites.

| Key    |        Values         | Default |
|--------|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| `filename` | [Filename](#filename) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
filename: test_boss.yml
```

</div>

</details>

</div>

***

**Minimum Viability**

`summonType: SUMMON_TYPE` and `filename: filename.yml` are enough on their own to create a Custom Reinforcement. The following example demonstrates this.

<div align="center">

<details>

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
isEnabled: true
entityType: ENDER_DRAGON
name: $eventBossLevel &eBinder of Worlds
level: 200
powers:
- ender_dragon_arrow_bombardment.yml
- summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER
  filename: binder_of_worlds_phase_1_parkour_reinforcement.yml
```

*However, if you want or need something more complex, keep reading below to see what else you can do with these options.*

</div>

</details>

</div>

<div align="center">

***

### chance

This is an optional config field made to compliment the `summonType` `ONCE` and `ON_HIT` options. It represents the chance of the Custom Reinforcement spawning when a boss gets hit.

| Key    |        Values         | Default |
|--------|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| `chance` | [Double](#double) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
chance: 0.5
```
*Represents a 50% chance to spawn a Custom Reinforcement.*

</div>

</details>

***

### location

`location: x,y,z` is an optional config field which allows admins to offset the location of the reinforcement by a number of blocks. Here are the key concepts you need to know about this option:

**The offset location is relative.** This means that `location: 0,10,0` will spawn a boss exactly 10 blocks above the boss, and not on world coordinates 0,10,0.


**The relative location is different for regional bosses.** Regional bosses will always use their spawn point as the origin for the relative location, meaning that if you know where the spawn point of the boss is and count the blocks, you can get reinforcement bosses to spawn in specific locations. The Binder of Worlds lair relies on this to spawn the challenge tower bosses in extremely specific block positions, regardless of where the dragon boss is.


**Bosses will spawn inside of blocks if you mess up measuring distances.**

| Key    |      Values       | Default |
|--------|:-----------------:|:-------:|
| `location` | [String](#string) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
location: 0,10,0
```
*For a non-regional Custom Boss will spawn the reinforcement exactly 10 blocks above the boss, regardless of where it might be.*

*For a regional Custom Boss will spawn the reinforcement exactly 10 blocks above the spawn point of the regional boss, regardless of where the boss is.*

</div>

</details>

_**Important note: This is a mandatory field for `summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL` specifically!**_

***

### lightningRod

Is a special setting only useful for `summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL`. This gives end crystals the ability to smite the floor around them on a delay. 

It can't be used with the other Custom Reinforcements, as those should rely on powers for these kinds of abilities.

| Key    |       Values        | Default |
|--------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `lightningRod` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `false` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
lightningRod: false
```

</div>

</details>

***

### inheritAggro

Is an optional config field which makes Custom Reinforcements inherit the threat levels of the boss. 

This is especially useful when you want to have the reinforcements that spawn target the person who is dealing the largest amount of damage.

| Key    |       Values        | Default |
|--------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `inheritAggro` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `false` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
inheritAggro: false
```

</div>

</details>

***

### amount

Is an optional config field which sets the amount of Reinforcements that spawn.

| Key    |       Values        | Default |
|--------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `amount` | [Integer](#integer) |   `1`   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
amount: 1
```

</div>

</details>

***

### spawnNearby

Is an optional config field which sets whether the Custom Reinforcement should spawn nearby instead of on top of the boss or at a specific relative location. 

This method should take terrain variation into account correctly, and not spawn bosses inside of walls, though in some setups it might result in them spawning behind walls if the combat area is too small. Has a ~30 blocks radius.

| Key    |       Values        | Default |
|--------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `spawnNearby` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `false` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
spawnNearby: false
```

</div>

</details>

***

### inheritLevel

Is an optional config field which sets whether the Custom Reinforcement should inherit the level of the Custom Boss it is reinforcing.

| Key    |       Values        | Default |
|--------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `inheritLevel` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `false` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
inheritLevel: false
```

</div>

</details>

***

### customSpawn

Is a config field which is only used for global reinforcements. It uses the custom spawn settings to set where the reinforcements will be able to spawn. 

This can be used to make reinforcements able to spawn on the surface, in places with light, in specific biomes and so on. Check the wiki page on [Custom Spawns]($language$/elitemobs/creating_spawns.md) for more details

| Key    |        Values         | Default |
|--------|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| `customSpawn` | [Filename](#filename) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
customSpawn: normal_surface_spawn.yml
```

</div>

</details>

</div>

## Putting a big reinforcement together

Let's create an example reinforcement using most of the previous fields:

```yaml
- summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER
  filename: test_boss.yml
  spawnNearby: true
  inheritAggro: true
  inheritLevel: true
```

This does the following:

- Creates a Custom Reinforcement
- The Custom Reinforcement will spawn when the Custom Boss enters combat (`summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER`)
- The Custom Reinforcement summoned will be the one from `test_boss.yml` (`filename: test_boss.yml`)
- The Custom Reinforcement will spawn within 30 blocks of the Custom Boss' current location (`spawnNearby: true`)
- The Custom Reinforcement will inherit the aggro of the Custom Boss it is reinforcing, meaning it will attack the player who has dealt the most damage (`inheritAggro: true`)
- Regardless of the setting in `test_boss.yml` , the Custom Reinforcement will have the same level as the Custom Boss it is reinforcing (`inheritLevel: true`)

```yaml
- summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL
  location: -80,10,0
  lightningRod: true
```

This does the following:

- Creates a Custom Reinforcement
- The Custom Reinforcement will be an End Crystal which gets placed down when the combat starts (`summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL`)
- The End Crystal will smite the ground around on a delay (`lightningRod: true`)

Now to apply this to the Custom Boss:

```yaml
isEnabled: true
entityType: ENDER_DRAGON
name: $eventBossLevel &eBinder of Worlds
level: 200
powers:
- ender_dragon_arrow_bombardment.yml
- summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER
  filename: test_boss.yml
  spawnNearby: true
  inheritAggro: true
  inheritLevel: true
- summonType: ON_COMBAT_ENTER_PLACE_CRYSTAL
  location: -80,10,0
  lightningRod: true
```

And you're done! Here are a few more tips:

- The fields can be set in any order, though it is recommended to always have `summonable` first!
- This is a big improvement on the old reinforcements system, which is no longer listed. It is not recommended to rely on it at this point, as it may cease to work in the future.

# What are Custom Spawns?

Custom Spawns are used by Events and global reinforcements to set how, where and when an event should spawn the boss for that event.

Events and global reinforcements set which spawn they are using by writing down its filename.

# Creating Custom Spawns

Custom Spawns go into the `customspawns` folder. One Custom Spawn can be used by several events at the same time, so you don't have to create one per event.

Here is an example Custom Spawn:

```yaml
isEnabled: true
validWorldTypes:
- NORMAL
- CUSTOM
bypassWorldGuard: false
isSurfaceSpawn: true
```

## Making an Anywhere Spawn
To make a spawn that can occur **anywhere**, your configuration should resemble the following:

```yml
isEnabled: true
canSpawnInLight: true
```
This configuration allows mobs to spawn in any location, in any world, at any time, and during any moon phase.

If you're interested in creating a more customized spawn, keep reading below.

# Creating World Bosses
*World Bosses are also sometimes referred to as Regional Bosses.*
## What are they?

World Bosses are Custom Bosses set to spawn in a specific location on a specific delay. These are also the bosses used in Dungeons. Though in this section we will specifically be discussing making World Bosses for use outside of dungeons.

## What are they for?

World Bosses allow players to face a fixed challenge while knowing that the loot will be rewarding.

## What do I need to make a World Boss?

1. **A location**. A boss room is recommended, with a roughly 15 block radius (30 blocks across) due to the Minecraft aggro range. Additionally, make sure that the terrain is protected through a [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) region (so players can't build traps) and that the terrain can't be exploited for combat.
2. **A respawn time**. The respawn timer is essential. I don't recommend doing less than a 30 minute respawn timer or else the boss respawning will be less of an event. 1 hour is a fairly good time, but you may also want to make it so the boss respawns once per day or even once per week.
3. **An escape time**. The longer the respawn, the longer the escape time should be. Also take into account that the escape time should be long enough that people can comfortably challenge the boss. Escape timers are important if you don't want to allow players to kamikaze the boss to death. This is not mandatory, nor even recommended if you want to do massive week-long respawn bosses.
4. **A Custom Boss**. World Bosses are really just Custom Bosses with custom spawning rules. Make sure you select powers with a good raid-size combat compatibility.
5. **Interesting loot**. The big draw for the World Bosses, challenge aside, is the loot. Make sure that players can get something from it that they simply can't get from elsewhere.
6. **A theme**. A good Regional boss should have a theme, with a thematic location and thematic loot.

## Custom Boss configuration options for World Bosses:

These settings are added to the normal Custom Boss config files. [An extensive wiki page on those can be found here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md).

<div align="center">

***

### isRegionalBoss

Sets whether the boss is a regional boss. Regional bosses are another name for World Bosses, so you want to set that to `true`.

| Key       |       Values        | Default |
|-----------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `isRegionalBoss` | [Boolean](#boolean) | `false` |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
isRegionalBoss: true
```

</div>

</details>

***

### spawnLocations

Spawn locations should be set from in-game using the command `/em addSpawnLocation <filename.yml>`.

While it is possible to manually add locations from config, I don't recommend trying to do that as it is just too easy to get it wrong.

| Key              |           Values            | Default |
|------------------|:---------------------------:|:-------:|
| `spawnLocations` | [String List](#string_list) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

Locations in configuration files (for advanced users) The Regional Boss' config files stores all the instances of that Regional Boss in a single file by storing multiple spawn locations as well as respawn timers. 

In practical terms, that means that this entry:

```yaml
spawnLocations:
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-70.17178578884845,168.2,-173.17112099568718,-271.24023,64.19999:1610710903931
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-135.02262355317436,168.2,-153.28849346821508,-98.53906,60.750263:1609026066482
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-70.43846307626053,168.2,-174.13499832314378,-271.24023,64.19999:1610710886530
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-130.39762674971664,168.2,-171.67396911490718,-47.532227,51.900173:1609026066482
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-117.12782160766056,162.2,-166.40989416757444,-71.37402,-1.4997427:1610710974882
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-105.13138759611667,168.2,-169.85898023126538,-124.34766,41.24988:1610710945331
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-106.21847515732084,169.2,-152.3609257554766,-170.86523,21.450315:1610537606222
```

contains 7 different Regional Bosses, in different locations, and with different respawn timers. 

Let's break the details down, taking a look at the first Regional Boss:

```yaml
- elitemobs_sewer_maze,-70.17178578884845,168.2,-173.17112099568718,-271.24023,64.19999:1610710903931
```

Since this follows the format `world,x,y,z,pitch,yaw:unixTimeStamp`, the boss is spawning in a world called `elitemobs_sewer_maze`at x = `-70.17178578884845`, y = `168.2`, z = `-173.17112099568718`, pitch = `-271.24023`, yaw = `64.19999`.

The unix timestamp stores the time, in unix time, at which the boss will respawn. This is used to store respawn times through restarts. If you wish to know what time that corresponds to, there are countless unix time to real time conversion tools you can find online. 

If you wish to have a specific boss respawn after a reload or restart, all you need to do it clear the `:unixTimeStamp` entry.

</details>

***

### spawnCooldown

Sets how long it takes for the boss to respawn, in **minutes**.

**Note: longer respawns are recommended for big bosses!**.

| Key       |       Values        | Default |
|-----------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `spawnCooldown` | [Integer](#integer) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
spawnCooldown: 20
```

</div>

</details>

***

### leashRadius

Sets the radius from the `spawnLocation` that the World Boss go to before getting teleported back to its spawn point. This prevent players from dragging the boss to a location where it could be easier to fight it.

**Note: try avoiding making combat areas that require leashes shorter than 20 blocks, as it will make the fight worse.**

| Key       |       Values        | Default |
|-----------|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| `leashRadius` | [Integer](#integer) |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
leashRadius: 30
```

</div>

</details>

***

### Transitive Blocks

Also known as `onSpawnBlockStates` and `onRemoveBlockStates`.

These values allow Regional Bosses to spawn blocks when they enter combat and to remove them when they get removed, meaning when they either escape due to timeout or when they die.

**This is how you can make bosses open or close doors / areas or even modify an arena during combat if you are using it with phase bosses!**

| Key       |          Values          | Default |
|-----------|:------------------------:|:-------:|
| `onSpawnBlockStates` | See Detailed Explanation |  none   |


| Key       | Values  | Default |
|-----------|:-------:|:-------:|
| `onRemoveBlockStates` | See Detailed Explanation |  none   |

<details> 

<summary><b>Detailed Explanation</b></summary>

<div align="left">

**All of the blocks are relative to the spawn location. Make sure that you have your final spawn location before starting to set any blocks.**

</br>If you already made a large Transitive Block area and now need to move the boss, but you do not want to redo the Transitive Blocks. Then you can use the EliteScript [Teleport]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_actions.md&section=teleport) action to move the boss to the correct location after it spawns. Do keep in mind that you will have to adjust your leash accordingly.

Due to the complexity of setting blocks, it is not recommended you do this manually. You should use the following commands to do it:

- /em registerblocks <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>
- /em registerblocksedit <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>
- /em registerblocksarea <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>
- /em registerblocksareaedit <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>
- /em cancelblocks

Let's break this down.

**/em registerblocks <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>**

The most basic command. This is a toggle that you run once to start, and again to commit. Just like all other commands, you pick whether you are setting these blocks to be modified for the `on_spawn` or the `on_remove` state.

If registering the on\_spawn, this will modify the blocks when the boss spawns or respawns. If registering the on\_remove, this will modify the blocks when the boss dies or times out using the Custom Boss timeout mechanic.

To register blocks, simply place or remove the blocks you wish to modify while this setting is on.

**/em registerblocksedit <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>**

If you want to modify already set blocks, you can use this command. Works in a very similar way to `/em registerblocks <regional_boss_file.yml> <on_spawn/on_remove>`.

**/em registerblocksarea <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>**

Just like `/em registerblocks <regional_boss_file.yml> <on_spawn/on_remove>`, this allows you to register blocks, but it allows selecting them by getting two diametrically opposed corners (same as the worldedit / worldguard region selection) instead of individually selecting blocks. 

For safety reasons, there is a cap of 200 blocks (by default, modifiable in config.yml) for regional selections. Keep in mind that every block gets modified on the same tick, so if you are modifying a lot of terrain you will probably start seeing big lag spikes when running these modifications.

**/em registerblocksareaedit <regional\_boss\_file.yml> <on\_spawn/on\_remove>**

Works the same way as `/em registerblocksedit` but for areas. Can be used to go over the 200 (default) block registration limit for areas.

**/em cancelblocks**

At any time, if a mistake is made while registering blocks, you can run this command to cancel registration. It will revert any changes you started registering on that edit / registration.

## Pro tips to make a good, big Regional Boss fight

1. **Actually think about how the powers on your Custom Boss compliment each other**. You don't want your boss to spend most of its time stopped because he's casting something, as that can actually make the fight really easy. You also don't want the boss to have all ranged attacks and no melee powers or the opposite unless you're designing something very specific. Playtesting is important.


2. **Health - lots of it**. That health multiplier should probably be at a solid 10 if you want people to actually group up to fight the boss.


3. **Damage - not too much**. EliteMobs are already extremely deadly by default, and the powers tend to be exponentially deadlier. Instead of boosting the damage through the ceiling, consider using powers to make the boss hit harder.


4. **Exploits, everywhere**. Make extra sure the terrain isn't exploitable. Put the boss in a closed room to prevent people from trying to snipe it from far. The arrow invulnerability power is probably extremely important for a lot of World Bosses since Minecraft mobs can't deal with getting sniped from chunks away, so if you want to allow bow attacks make sure bows can't be exploited.


5. **Know the plugin**. There's a lot of tiny tricks to beating EliteMobs, like how some powers can be countered by using shields, while others should be countered by dodging or even temporarily running away from the boss. The more you know how the powers work and how they're countered, the better the bosses you make will be.

# What are Wormholes?

Wormholes are a kind of highly efficient portal-to-portal teleportation system. The portals are marked with visual effects.

# Wormhole mechanics

Wormholes can do the following:

*   Go through one portal to reach the destination portal, and go from the destination portal back to the first one.
*   Play a sound when players go through them
*   Temporarily blind players while going through them to smooth the transition
*   Push players out to avoid getting caught in a teleport loop
*   Lock players out of teleportation for 5 seconds to avoid getting caught in a teleport loop
*   Play elaborate visual effects
*   Require permissions to use the wormhole
*   Require the use of currency to use the wormhole
*   Notify players and admins when the destination portal is not available

# Creating a Wormhole

Wormholes are added as configuration files to the wormholes folder. It is possible to create subfolders, and it is recommended to do so if you are adding wormholes for specific dungeons, under the format \` ~/plugins/EliteMobs/wormholes/dungeonName/dungeonName\_identifier.yml\`.

### Ejection

Yaw and Pitch (The last two digits in the coordinates) in the `location1` and `location2` will set where the players will get ejected from the wormhole when they travel through it. Let look at this example:

`location1: my_world,20,10,20,180,20`

With Yaw being set at `180` the player would get ejected facing North, and with Pitch being set at `20` they would also get ejected slightly upwards. If you wish the player to remain in the same block as the wormhole when being ejected, then it is a good idea to set the Pitch to negative to make sure the players do not slide off from the block.

## Wormhole Config
The following is an example of a valid Wormhole config:

```yaml
isEnabled: true
location1: em_primis,1288.5,19,452.5,135,-23

<summary align="center"><b>Wormhole Config Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

In this example we will make a simple wormhole that takes us from one world into another. Do not forget that wormholes can also just teleport players to a different location in the same world.

```yml
isEnabled: true #We enable the worm by setting this value to true

#### Performance Issues

The wormhole particles can cause client performance issues for players that are running bedrock. If you would like to turn off the wormhole particles you can go to `~plugins\EliteMobs\Wormholes.yml` and change the `noParticlesMode` setting to `true`.

# Critical Strikes

Critical Strikes give a chance to double the damage dealt to an Elite Mob.

Each level of Critical Strike increases the critical strike chance by 10% (10% for level 1, 20% for level 2).

Procedurally generated items cap off at level 2 by default.

# Drilling

The drilling enchantment is an enchantment for pickaxes. It allows pickaxes and shovels using it to mine blocks in a radius to the block getting mined. The higher the level of the enchantments, the higher the radius of blocks affected.

The levels range between 1 and 5, with 1 additional block getting mined at level 1 and 9 additional blocks getting mined at level 5. Only blocks of the same type will be mined in that radius.

[Watch this video for a visual representation of how this works.](https://youtu.be/CM78o_-Aa0s)

# Elite Protection/Sharpness/Power/Bane of Arthropods/Smite/...

Elite Protection/Sharpness/Power/Bane of Arthropods/Smite/... increases level of a vanilla enchantment but only applies this special value when fighting against elites.

**Items only start gaining Elite enchantments once they've gone over the vanilla limits of the enchantment level (as an example, vanilla protection caps off at level 4). All subsequent levels are increased by 1, meaning that an item with protection 5 and elite protection 10 will count as a protection 15 armor for Elite Mobs, but will only count as a protection 5 armor for any other mob.**

These enchantments only apply when fighting against mobs from EliteMobs, and do not apply in pvp or when fighting other mobs.

# Flamethrower

Any item with the Flamethrower enchantment is capable of firing a jet of flames to damage mobs in the direction it's been fired.

Upon right clicking to activate this enchantment, the player becomes unable to move for the duration of the effect.

Using the Flamethrower enchantment uses up the durability of the item.

This custom enchantment can never damage players for balance reasons.

# Hunter

The Hunter enchantment increases the percentage of mobs around a player with that enchantment which get converted into Elite Mobs, effectively increasing the amount of Elite Mobs that spawn around a player.

The conversion rate per level is configurable, and each subsequent level will increase the conversion rate by that amount. The maximum enchantment level for the hunter enchantment is level 3.

# Ice Breaker

The Ice Breaker enchantment allows any item to freeze water on hit. It is recommended that you only add it to pickaxes.

The Ice Breaker enchantment can have up to two levels. On the first level, the pickaxe will only freeze the block hit. On the second, it will freeze it and the immediately adjacent blocks.

The second level enchantment can be used to create tunnels under the ocean.

[Watch this video if you want to see it in action.](https://youtu.be/k206wfEBCqs)

# Earthquake

The Earthquake enchantment makes a player do a big jump when sneaking twice while wearing the boots, and knocks mobs back when the player lands.

# Grappling Hook

The Grappling Hook enchantment when applied to bows makes players able to grapple on to [target blocks](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Target) when shooting any kind of arrow.

# Lightning

The Lightning enchantment works in a way similar to the critical strikes enchantment, but deals 2.5x damage in a 2.5 block diameter and spawns a lightning strike. The chance of a lightning enchantment triggering is very low.

# Loud Strikes

The Loud Strikes enchantment increases the aggro on hit for entities spawned by EliteMobs. Elites and bosses usually target the player that dealt the most damage, but this enchantment allows tanks to keep the mob's attention even if they are not the highest damage. This is used for traditional MMORPG tanking roles. This enchantment is mainly used for [Instanced Dungeons]($language$/EliteMobs/building_for_elitemobs.md&section=instanced-dungeons) and is found on loot that drops from these dungeons.

# Plasma Boots

The Plasma Boots enchantment, when double shifting, makes players do a short jump and then spawns green particles in every direction which damage entities if they get hit by them. This uses up the durability of the boots.

# Summon Merchant

The Summon Merchant enchantment summons Jeeves. This is done by right clicking the item (this is usually just a paper), or saying "Jeeves!" in chat. Summoning Jeeves uses up the item with the enchantment.

# Summon Wolf

The Summon Wolf enchantment summons a friendly wolf when *Shift + Right Clicking* the floor with the item in hand. The wolf has a level calculated based on the player's equipment and despawns after 2 minutes. It can not be tamed.

There is a 1/1000 chance of spawning Snoopy when summoning a wolf. Snoopy is far more powerful than normal wolves.

Using the Summon Wolf enchantment uses up the item used for the summoning.

# Unbind

The Unbind enchantment is used in the Unbind scroll as the required enchantment for the unbind menu / npc. Check the [Soulbind](#Soulbind) section for more details.

# Soulbind

Soulbind is a very special enchantment and [can be checked on this page]($language$/elitemobs/soulbind.md).

As of EliteMobs 7.3.12, Custom Models have been added to EliteMobs through [Model Engine](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?resources/model-engine%E2%80%94ultimate-entity-model-manager-1-16-5-1-20-4.389/) and [FreeMineCraftModels](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/free-minecraft-models.111660/).

# Foreword

From an EliteMobs perspective, the Custom Model system is very simple, as the only thing admins have to do is add a line to an NPC or Custom Boss config file telling it which Custom Model to use. However, it is necessary to take the correct steps with Model Engine and Minecraft in order to get this system fully functional, and these aren't quite as easy to get into.

This guide will go into detail insofar as interfacing with Model Engine and Minecraft goes. It will not tell you how to use Blockbench to create custom bosses, nor will it go into detail about how Model Engine works. There are already plenty of guides on how to do that elsewhere, and if you want to learn more about those systems you are better served by looking directly at their documentation.

## FreeMineCraft Models

If you want to learn how you can use FMM to get your models working then you can check out [this]($language$/freeminecraftmodels/info.md) wiki page to learn more.

# Minimum requirements

EliteMobs 7.3.12 or later, Model Engine R2.2.0\* or later, Blockbench\*\*, a using Minecraft Resource Packs.

\* This plugin may have further dependencies. Check the documentation on their end.  
\*\* Necessary for creating and editing Custom Models. Not necessary if you are just looking to install content without modifying it.

# Manually setting a Custom Model

Note: This guide assumes you already have a valid Custom Model. These come in Blockbench file formats (`.bbmodel`).

EliteMobs is able to use Custom Models for NPCs and Custom Bosses. The process to do this is the same for both, and is as follows:

## Step 1. Setting the EliteMobs config

Go to the configuration file of the Custom Boss or NPC you want to modify and add the following line:

```yaml
customModel: modelname
```

Replace `modelname` with the name of your model. The name is the name of the Custom Model file you are using. As an example, the Test Boss' Custom Model file is `showcase_boss.bbmodel`. As such, the configuration option should be

```yaml
customModel: showcase_boss
```

And that's it for EliteMobs! Now it gets a bit trickier.

## Step 2. Generating the Model Engine data

[_Note: In case of doubt or issues, refer to the Model Engine wiki here._](https://github.com/Ticxo/Model-Engine-Wiki/wiki/Importing-and-Exporting#importing)

1.  Put your Custom Model Blockbench file (`.bbmodel`) into the directory `(yourServer)/plugins/ModelEngine/blueprints` .
2.  Run the command `/meg reload` . If everything worked correctly, you should get a message saying `[Model Engine] X models loaded` , where `x` is the amount of models you have registered.

## Step 3. Generating the Resource Pack

[**Note: there is now an alternative, simpler way to do this step on this link.**]($language$/elitemobs/custom_models.md&section=step-2.-generating-the-resource-pack) However, it is a little bit less flexible than what is listed here.

This is possibly the trickiest part if you are looking to make your server manage the downloads. **Try checking if the system works when you have the resource pack on your client before looking into distributing it automatically!**

1.  Go to the directory `(yourServer)/plugins/ModelEngine/resource pack` and create a resource pack using that data or add the `assets` folder in there to your resource pack's `assets`
    1.  If you are creating a new resource pack, you can put the files in `resource pack` into a zipped file, and that will be a valid resource pack you can distribute. [More info](https://github.com/Ticxo/Model-Engine-Wiki/wiki/Importing-and-Exporting#preexisting-resource-pack).
    2.  If you already have a resource pack, make sure you aren't accidentally overwriting existing models. [More info](https://github.com/Ticxo/Model-Engine-Wiki/wiki/Importing-and-Exporting#preexisting-resource-pack).
2.  Distribute your resource pack to your players. **Only players that have the resource pack will be able to see the Custom Models**, and it will look very weird and broken to everyone else. If you intend to make heavy use of these, you may want to force the resource pack use.
    1.  (Optional) To allow players to download a resource pack on login, you will need to host the file somewhere online and change the server.properties `resource-pack=` field to point to that address.**\***
    2.  (Optional) If you are modifying the resource packs, you will want to use the `resource-pack-sha1=` option so the server can check if the player's resource pack needs to be updated. To generate this value, upload your resource pack to [http://onlinemd5.com/](http://onlinemd5.com/) and make sure you pick the SHA1 option. You will have to do this every time you update your Resource Pack, or else your users won't get the update.**\***
    3.  (Optional) To force players to use resource packs, use the option `require-resource-pack=true` in server.properties.**\***

**If you modified server.properties you will need to restart!**

**\*** Note: There are a lot of guides online that can help you get this working if these instructions aren't helping you.

### Merge resource packs

Should you need to merge your resource packs you can do so manually. But we recommend using an online tool such as [merge.elmakers](https://merge.elmakers.com/) to merge your resource packs.

## Step 4. Hope it works

Assuming everything was done correctly, you should now be able to see the Custom Model on your boss or NPC. You can spawn them through the commands:

*   Custom Boss: `/em spawncustom filename.yml`
*   NPC: `/em spawnnpc filename.yml`

You can then remove them through the command `/em remove`.

# Creating and adapting Custom Models for EliteMobs

EliteMobs is able to use any model considered valid by Model Engine, which means there isn't much that can't be done with it.

However, when it comes to animations, the use of specific names for the animations is required to guarantee that the bosses can use the animations.

These animation names are the ones set on Blockbench in the animations tab. You can rename them at any time, meaning you can retrofit any existing models to work with EliteMobs.

## Animations

Please note that this section is still expanding, as this system is still very recent. More will be added to it as feature requests roll in.

### idle

`idle` is the correct animation name for entities that are not in combat and not moving. EliteMobs does not modify the default idle animation system Model Engine uses.

### walk

`walk` is the correct animation name for entities that are moving. EliteMobs does not modify the default idle animation system Model Engine uses.

### attack

There are three types of attack animations:

#### attack

`attack` is the correct generic animation name for when a boss attacks.

#### attack_melee

`attack_melee` is the correct animation name for attacks done when a Custom Boss attacks an entity using a vanilla Minecraft melee attack. Overrides `attack` . Please note that the animation plays **after** the damage is dealt. This is unfortunately a limitation for now. As such, try to make the animation very fast.

#### attack_ranged

`attack_ranged` is the correct animation name for attacks done when a Custom Boss spawns a projectile entity. Overrides `attack`. Please note that the animation plays **after** the projectile is fired. This is unfortunately a limitation for now. As such, try to make the animation very fast.

### damaged

`damaged` is the correct animation name for the hurt animation that a Custom Boss plays when damaged.

### death

`death` is the correct animation name for death animation. EliteMobs does not modify the default idle animation system Model Engine uses.

### powers

Note: this segment is still in development. The following are the features as they are planned.

Every power in EliteMobs can have an animation assigned to it. The animation always starts when the power is triggered, and no further triggers are currently provided throughout the use of the power. Some powers, such as the invulnerabilities, won't do anything as they have no triggers and are just passive properties of the bosses.

In order to assign an animation to a power, the animation must be named the same as the elitemobs power file.

As an example, to add an animation to the zombie necronomicon power, the animation should be called `zombie_necronomicon.yml` . It will start playing as soon as the power is triggered, and end when the animation ends if it is not set to loop or when the power is done.

# Importing Custom Models from dungeons

## Step 1. Normal import

Upon importing a dungeon packager zipped folder that contains Custom Models, the Custom Models get automatically moved to `(yourServer)/plugins/ModelEngine/blueprints` and Model Engine automatically reloads to generate the relevant resource pack and Model Engine files.

## Step 2. Generating the Resource Pack

If you are online when you reload EliteMobs in order to import files, EliteMobs will automatically post a message in chat which you can click to generate the EliteMobs resource pack. Alternatively, you can run the command `/em generateresourcepack` in order to generate it.

Running this command copies all the resource pack files to the EliteMobs `exports` folder in a non-destructive way. This means that if you unzip a resource pack into the exports folder using the resource pack name `elitemobs_resource_pack` for your resource pack folder EliteMobs will not delete any of the files in there unless a file with the same name is obtained from ModelEngine (except for pack.meta and pack.png). This way you are able to update your resource pack without losing the models you've previously put into it.

Finally, EliteMobs zips the resource pack in the `exports` folder, and this file is ready for distribution

After this is done, EliteMobs also suggests updating the SHA1 code for your resource pack.

### Step 2.5. Updating the SHA1

The SHA1 code in the `server.properties` file is used to let clients know if their resource pack is outdated, and makes them update it if necessary. This code can be generated through EliteMobs by clicking on the option on chat which appears after step 2, or by running the command `/em updateresourcepack`

**Keep in mind that this updates your server.properties file with the correct SHA1 code for the zipped resource pack in the `exports` folder.** If you delete it or modify the zipped file after running the command it will not work.

## Step 3. Make the file publicly available

Host the file at a location of your choice. Some people use Google Drive or Dropbox for this. It is better to host this file yourself, if you have the ability to do so. Some plugins out there might also help you host it directly from your Minecraft server. If you find a plugin like that that works, let MagmaGuy know on Discord and this post will be updated with that info.

This is a comprehensive breakdown of how the health / damage scales in EliteMobs. It should be used as a reference when designing dungeons.

It's focused on Custom Bosses, but normal Elites scale in the same way.

# Before you start!

You don't need to read all of this if you just want to do quick tweaks. Skip to the "Using this data for dungeons" section to see very simplified quick maths and a series of premade recommended settings!

# Scaling (in general)

In EliteMobs, by default, bosses get 7 max health and deal 1 more damage per level.

Player weapons deal 7 more damage per level, and armor reduces 0.25 damage per level (but there are 4 armor slots that contribute to the total, which amounts to 1). Finally, players gain maximum health as they unlock the prestige ranks.

# Damage dealt by Custom Bosses

The damage formula for Custom Bosses is:

```
( ( ( baseline damage / 2 ) * custom boss damage multiplier) + level of the boss - player armor reduction ) * global damage multiplier
```

## baseline damage

This can be one of two things:

1.  The value in mobproperties for the entity type of the boss.
2.  Since this can be hard to keep in mind to while designing dungeons and other content, Custom Bosses can have the normalizedCombat field, which applies a standard 5 damage, which has the best scaling for EliteMobs progression. In a later update, normalized combat will be enabled by default for all regional bosses.

## custom boss damage multiplier

This is the damage multiplier in the Custom Boss file. Defaults to 1.

## level of the boss

As you might guess, this is just the level of the boss. This means that bosses deal one more damage per level.

## player armor reduction

Player armor reduces 0.25 damage per level, and there are 4 armor slots that can contribute to the total. Additionally, each level of projectile protection reduces projectile damage by 0.025.

## global damage multiplier

This is the multiplier in MobCombatSettings. Defaults to 1.

# Maximum health of Custom Bosses

The health formula for Custom Bosses is:

```
( baseline max health + level of the boss * 7 ) * custom boss health multiplier
```

## baseline max health

This can be one of two things:

1.  The default maximum health of the vanilla Minecraft entity.
2.  Since this can be hard to keep in mind to while designing dungeons and other content, Custom Bosses can have the normalizedCombat field, which applies a standard 7 health, which has the best scaling for EliteMobs progression. Normalized combat is enabled by default for all regional bosses.

## level

This is the level of the boss

## custom boss health multiplier

This is the multiplier in the Custom Boss file. Defaults to 1.

# Damage dealt to Custom Bosses

The damage formula that players hit Custom Bosses with has too many small variables like critical strikes and cooldowns to explain in-depth here. A simplified version looks like this:

```
damage = Level of the weapon
```

This is what the damage should roughly look like in an ideal average setting.

# Using this data for dungeons

**NOTE: THIS ASSUMES YOU'RE USING THE `normalizedCombat` VALUES!** Those values were specifically made for balancing dungeons more easily.

Part of a boss' difficulty is making it have the appropriate health and damage for the encounter. However, keep in mind that this is only a part of it, and that powers are just as important.

The following is presented in the correct format for the Custom Boss file.

## The easy quick maths

1.  EliteMobs has 7 hits as the amount of hits that a player with a weapon of the same level as a boss takes to kill it, assuming no modifiers.
    1.  This means that a 2.0 multiplier means players will have to hit the boss 2 x 7 = 14 times. 0.5 means 7 / 2 = 3.5 .
2.  The baseline normalizedCombat damage, assuming the player's armor is the same level as the boss, is 2.5 damage or 1.25 hearts of damage per hit.
    1.  This means that a 2.0 multiplier means that players will lose 3 hearts per hit, and a 0.5 multiplier will make players lose 0.75 hearts per hit.

**Keep in mind that players tend to prioritize weapons, and often end up with much worse armor than weapons. Unless you design very specific types of arenas with range combat, you probably don't want to deal a lot of damage per hit.** Playtest your content!

## Creating an average dungeon mob

With the scaling of normalizedCombat, you can apply a very minimalistic configuration:

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 1.0 #4 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.0 #1.5 hearts of dmg
```

**Note: since 1.0 is the default, this means you can also just not define anything**.

## Creating trash packs

Trash packs are numerous but not very dangerous:

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 0.7 #3 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 0.5 #0.5 hearts of dmg
```

## Creating reinforcements

Reinforcements should die very easily, but pose a danger damage-wise (these values recommended for 4+ melee entities, actual use may vary):

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 0.25 #1 hit to slay 
damageMultiplier: 0.6 #1 heart of dmg
```

## Creating minibosses

Minibosses should hold their ground, and pose a mechanic challenge to players. It should be a test of skill that lasts for a little while, but not something extremely deadly:

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 3.0 #10 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.2 #2 hearts of dmg
```

## Creating bosses

Bosses are a real challenge, the conclusion of a buildup in a dungeon and a real test of skill with everything on the line. Encounters should be long and death should be a present threat.

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 7.0 #23 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.4 #2.5 hearts of dmg
```

## Creating World Bosses

World bosses are dangerous, but most of all they have a lot of health and summon a lot of reinforcements / have a lot of area of effect attacks. These are meant to be fought by large groups of players over the longest amount of time an elite encounter should last. They aren't very deadly, but have a lot of mechanics that can overwhelm under prepared players.

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 40.0 #160 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.5 #2.5-3 hearts of dmg
```

These are just rough recommended values and any final values should be adjusted around the encounters themselves.

# Disabling explosion damage

## Disabling block damage

### Using gamerule

Run the command `/gamerule mobGriefing false`. This prevents all block damage from explosions.

### Using WorldGuard

Set the flag `ghast-fireball` to deny. This prevents all Ghast fireball damage.

## Disabling EliteMobs fireballs:

1. Go to the *~plugins\EliteMobs\powers* folder.
2. Go to *attack_fireball.yml* and set `isEnabled` to `false`.
3. Go to *tracking_fireball.yml* and set `isEnabled` to `false`.

EliteMobs uses DiscordSRV to enable the broadcast of level 3 priority messages. You can read about the Announcement Priority System [here]($language$/elitemobs/announcement_priority_system.md).

In essence, this means that some very special Custom Bosses are able to send messages on Discord in a way that looks like this:

![discord message example](https://i.imgur.com/sIndft0.png)

The intention is to create a dedicated EliteMobs announcement room that players can take a look at to see if there's any interesting World Bosses currently alive that they can go kill and show off that they did in the kill leaderboard.

# Setting it all up

## Setting up DiscordSRV

[DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/) is a different plugin not developed by me. [You can find their extensive setup guide here](https://github.com/discordsrv/discordsrv/wiki/Installation). If you have a hard time setting it up, [their support room is here](https://discord.discordsrv.com/). I am not able to provide support for this plugin, so please refer to them for this part of the installation.

## Setting up the EliteMobs DiscordSRV config

Once you've correctly configured DiscordSRV (*and you have to test to see if it's really working before you move to this step*), **the EliteMobs configuration only has 1 step**.

Go to the `DiscordSRV.yml` configuration file on the EliteMobs configuration folder and you will find a configuration option called `announcementRoomName`.

There are three values you can use for this message. I recommend #1.

1. [Recommended] The name of the room as you configured it on the DiscordSRV configuration file. It does not matter what you called the room, only that you use the correct name. Here's an example of the room I configured to be dedicated to EliteMobs events:
   ![using name example](https://i.imgur.com/a2kMWXv.png)
   In my case, the option should read `announcementRoomName: EMEvents`.

2. The ID of the room as you configured it on the DiscordSRV configuration file. Here's an example of the room. *Please note that each room is unique. I am only showing pictures as an example, do not try to copy the ID numbers. It will not work. Your setup should have a unique set of numbers based on your discord room id.*
   ![using id example](https://i.imgur.com/CGElkdh.png)
3. [Bad] The name of your room as it appears on discord. This is not guaranteed to work correctly due to a number of factors. Keep in mind that your discord room must be set up on DiscordSRV's config files - just because you can put the name of the room in this configuration file does not mean you can skip configuring it on DiscordSRV.

## Testing
You can use the command `/em discord [message]` to see if your configuration is working. If your message shows up, you're done!

# Dungeon Types

***Note: the following describes the premade content of EliteMobs. What you do in your server can be customized, and the features described below are simply a convenient way of grouping different types of content up.*** The content you make for your server can follow entirely different formats and rules.

## Open dungeons

Open dungeons are always open to all players. This means that any amount of players can enter the dungeon at any time to fight the same bosses. This is great for casual grouping up and farming, but can be complicated due to respawn timers.

For WoW / FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of open-world zones with world bosses.

### What's a Lair?
Lairs are a type of small dungeon which focuses on one big boss fight.

The structure: Lairs are usually restricted to a build around a big combat arena, and are the smallest size category of EliteMobs.

The fights: Players are expected to group up in groups of 5 to challenge the boss, as they are usually very challenging.

For FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of world bosses.

### What's a Minidungeon?
Minidungeons are a type of medium sized dungeon which usually contains 3-15 minibosses and a big boss, as well as a lot of "trash" mobs which are meant to be "farmed" for coins and gear by players.

The structure: The smallest minidungeons are the size of large ships, and the largest minidungeon can be quite expansive maps with hundreds of mobs roaming around for fights.

The fights: Minidungeons can be solo'd by veteran players, but groups of 2-3 players are recommended.

For WoW / FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of world bosses in zones that are challenging but rewarding to farm.

### What's an Adventure?
Adventures are full adventure maps. They include quests lines, npcs, large amounts of minibosses and bosses and can even contain their own arenas or dungeons inside of them.

The structure: These are always very large maps with dozens of large builds split off into different zones. They can also include secondary and tertiary worlds for several reasons.

The fights: Adventures can be solo'd by veteran players, but grouping up another player is recommended.

For WoW / FF14 fans, this is essentially the whole base game of questing and finding dungeons and fighting bosses along a questline.

## Instanced dungeons

Instanced dungeons are dungeons that create worlds as needed, allowing server to run as many simultaneous fights for as many players as necessary. It is the best option to create hard but fair content, and is the least exploitable type of content.

There are lot of features to Instanced Dungeons, which you can read about [here]($language$/elitemobs/instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md&section=how-it-works).

For WoW and FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of dungeons / duties instancing.

### Sanctums
Sanctums are the equivalent of instanced Lairs. This means that they focus around one huge boss fight. This is the hardest type of EliteMobs content, especially for the harder difficulties.

The structure: THese are usually small maps but can have very dynamic combat arenas. They are usually focused around a single large room.

The fights: Supposed to be fought by 5 players. At the highest difficulties, this is the hardest EliteMobs content there is.

For FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of Trials.

### Dungeons
Dungeons are the equivalent of instanced Minidungeons. This the the most traditional MMORPG type of dungeon, where players party up and go through a gauntlet of trash mobs and minibosses to fight a final boss.

For WoW and FF14 fans, this is the equivalent of Dungeons.

The structure: These are usually medium-sized maps, larger than minidungeons but much smaller than Adventures.

The fights: Supposed to be fought by parties of 5, harder than open dungeons but easier than Sanctums.

### Raids

Coming soon!

### Arenas

Arenas are wave-based survival areas in which players get rewarded for defeating waves. The arenas usually have some lore around them.

The structure: Arena-sized and arena-shaped.

The fights: Can be solo'd, but can be challenged by up to 5 players.

# What are dungeons?

You can find info about dungeons, including info about premade dungeons [here]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md).

***

# What is the dungeon packager?

The dungeon packager allows admins to not only create and package dungeons but also package any kind of EliteMobs content. This includes things such as event packs, model packs, arenas, npc packs, item packs and so on.

<details>

<summary>Why use dungeon packages?</summary>

- ***Instanced dungeons!*** Instanced dungeons can only be created through the dungeon package system.
- ***Safe backups of Minidungeons!*** If you make a Dungeon Package, you'll be able to deploy and redeploy it in any server you want at any time and for any reason.
- ***Easy to turn off and on!*** You can always do `/em setup` and temporarily or permanently turn Dungeon Packages off and on.
- ***Easy to share!*** If you wish to share your creations, Dungeon Packages can just be zipped up and sent to other people. There is a Discord room dedicated to community creations if you are interested!
- ***Teleports!*** Dungeon packages automatically create teleport locations which can be accessed in the Teleports page of the `/em` menu, which might be very useful in a lot of setups.

</details>

# Creating Dungeons

The following settings are used to create a configuration file which should go into the `dungeonpackages` folder. These settings are used to create dungeons specifically, and are not required if you just want to use the dungeon packager to distribute non-dungeon content such as a pack of items or events.

## Required plugins

In order to use the Dungeon Packager, you will need the following plugin:

[WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) - protects the Minidungeon

## Creating a dungeon, step-by-step

EliteMobs used to have two major kinds of dungeons: world-based and schematic-based.

Schematic-based dungeons, were associated with a schematic build. They are now phased out and not supported anymore.

All EliteMobs dungeons are now world based.

| `SANCTUM`    | Sanctums are the equivalent of instanced Lairs. This means that they focus around one huge boss fight. |
| `MINIDUNGEON`    | Minidungeons are a type of medium sized dungeon which usually contains 3-15 minibosses and a big boss, as well as a lot of "trash" mobs which are meant to be "farmed" for coins and gear by players. |
| `DUNGEON`    | Dungeons are the equivalent of instanced Minidungeons. This the the most traditional MMORPG type of dungeon, where players party up and go through a gauntlet of trash mobs and minibosses to fight a final boss. |
| `RAID`    | Coming soon!|
| `ADVENTURE`    | Adventures are full adventure maps. They include quests lines, npcs, large amounts of minibosses and bosses and can even contain their own arenas or dungeons inside of them. |
| `ARENA`    | Arenas are wave-based survival areas in which players get rewarded for defeating waves. |
| `OTHER`    | Anything else that does not alreeady fall in the previous categories. |

#### Instanced dungeons

*Instanced dungeons create a new world for every time a group of players wants to complete a dungeon, and deletes it when it's done. For this to work correctly, you must put a folder following the `dungeonConfigFolderName` in the the `world_blueprints` configuration folder of EliteMobs.*

*You then place the world you'll be using inside of the folder you created, making sure that the `session.lock` file of the world is deleted.*

The following values only apply to instanced dungeons. Note that all instanced dungeons are world dungeons, so they also use the values from world dungeons.

Setting instanced dungeon difficulties will automatically create different difficulty options when entering the dungeon. 

The difficulty names set here will be the ones used in the custom bosses folder, where you are able to set which powers bosses have based on the difficulty.

Difficulties are in a list format which have the following fields:

# Recommended Boss Values

## Creating an average dungeon mob

We recommend leaving the setting normalizedCombat set to true. This setting normalizes all mobs to scale equally with health and damage, regardless of their entity type.

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 1.0 #4 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.0 #1.5 hearts of dmg
```

Certainly, here's the revised version with clarity and formatting retained:

**Note: Given that `1.0` is the default value for health and damage, you can simply omit defining `healthMultiplier` or `damageMultiplier` and set `normalizedCombat` to `true`.**

## Creating trash packs

Trash packs are numerous but not very dangerous:

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 0.7 #3 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 0.5 #0.5 hearts of dmg
```

## Creating reinforcements

Reinforcements should die very easily, but pose a danger damage-wise (these values are recommended for 4+ melee entities, actual use may vary):

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 0.25 #1 hit to slay 
damageMultiplier: 0.6 #1 heart of dmg
```

## Creating minibosses

Minibosses should hold their ground, and pose a mechanic challenge to players. It should be a test of skill that lasts for a little while, but not something extremely deadly:

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 3.0 #10 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.2 #2 hearts of dmg
```

## Creating bosses

Bosses are a real challenge, the conclusion of a buildup in a dungeon and a real test of skill with everything on the line. Encounters should be long and death should be a present threat.

```yaml
normalizedCombat: true
healthMultiplier: 7.0 #23 hits to slay 
damageMultiplier: 1.4 #2.5 hearts of dmg
```

**These recommended values are merely rough estimates, and the final values should be adjusted according to the specific encounters.**

**This is particularly crucial for final dungeon bosses; you may want to significantly exceed the recommended 7.0 value for healthMultiplier to give the last fight that epic feeling.**

# Packaging EliteMobs content for distribution

Finally, you will probably want to package your dungeon either for storage or for distribution.

EliteMobs has an import system which allows admins to quickly import, install and uninstall content. [You can see how it works here.]($language$/elitemobs/setup.md)

## Trimming Worlds

Sometimes, you may need to reduce the size of your Minecraft world to make it lighter and, consequently, easier to distribute. This can be achieved through the use of the [WorldBorder plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldborder-1-15.80466/). Despite the plugin being listed as only supporting MineCraft up to version 1.19, it functions seamlessly on the latest MineCraft version as of January 25, 2024.

<details>
<summary>Tip</summary>
If you are doing this for the first time it might be a good idea to create a backup of your world just in case something goes wrong.
</details>

Once the plugin is installed, navigate to the middle of the world or the specific area you wish to trim. Then, execute the command `/wb set x`, where `x` represents the approximate radius size you want for your area.

<details>
<summary>Tip</summary>
If <code>/wb</code> is not working for you, try <code>/worldborder:wb</code>.
</details>

After executing this command, fly to the edges of your world to verify that the world border has been properly set and covers the intended size. You will recognize reaching the world border edge when you are pushed back, accompanied by a message in the chat.

![trim_pic_1.jpg](../../../img/wiki/trim_pic_1.jpg)

In the image above, we aim to trim the world around the purple blocks, leaving only a few chunks around them. To achieve this, we stand in the middle of the purple area on the red squares and execute `/wb set 50`, setting the world border just beyond the purple area.

Next, we use the `/wb trim [freq] [pad]` command, with the frequency set to 200 and the pad to 20. The pad determines how many chunks should be left around the world border (the purple area), and the frequency determines how many chunks should be processed per second. After running `/wb trim 200 20`, we will be prompted to confirm by executing `/wb trim confirm`. We confirm the action, and after some time, our world will be trimmed, reducing its size and making it more convenient for distribution.

You can now remove the world border using `/wb clear all` or just leave it if you wish.

## Trimming the world folder

There are several files and folders located in your world folder that we can discard since the plugins do not use all of them. This will cut down the size of your world and make it easier to distribute.

For a NORMAL world Environment:

To prepare your world, keep the following files and folders:

1. **region** folder
2. **raids.dat** from within the **data** folder (ensure it's placed inside the **data** folder when copying)
3. **level.dat** file

You can safely delete all other files and folders located in the world folder. This will set up your world correctly for the NORMAL environment.

For NETHER and THE_END world Environments:

To prepare your world, keep the following files and folders:

1. **region** folder inside the **DIM-1** folder (ensure it's placed inside the **DIM-1** folder when copying)
2. **raids.dat** from within the **data** folder (ensure it's placed inside the **data** folder when copying)
3. **level.dat** file

You can safely delete all other files and folders located in the world folder. This will set up your world correctly for the NETHER and THE_END environments.

## Running the package command

EliteMobs has the **`/em package <dungeonName> <version>`** command. This command goes through all the configuration folders of EliteMobs and automatically packages all content in folders that match the `dungeonName` into a zipped file and a normal folder in the `exports` folder of EliteMobs.

***For this reason, it is highly recommended you keep the content you want to package in folders with the same name as the name of your package.*** Otherwise, you will have to manually gather and package the files into the file structure for distribution.

## Adding the dungeon package file

If you are creating a dungeon, you will need to manually add the dungeon package file into the freshly generated folder in the exports folder. Your dungeon package configuration file should follow the format described above and be placed in a folder called `dungeonpackages`. [Check file structure for more on that.](#file-structure).

**Make sure you zip your dungeon once done!**

## File structure

If you did everything correctly, the file structure should be similar to this example, where we called the dungeon `my_cool_dungeon`:

<details>
<summary>my_cool_dungeon File Structure Example</summary>

- my_cool_dungeon.zip
    * dungeonpackages

</details>

This allows most users to drag and drop files directly on to their server and have it working immediately.

***Important: when packaging for distribution, make sure you UNINSTALL THE MINIDUNGEON FIRST! You don't want to distribute installed minidungeons, you want admins to set them up on their servers!***

# EliteMobs Config Defaults

**EliteMobs comes with the recommended defaults installed by default. If you change things at random, odds are you'll only make the experience worse overall.**

_**EliteMobs is provided to all users with the recommended default settings. If you change things at random and then request support, there is a very strong chance that you will be told to reset your configuration files. Modifications to the plugin should be borne of playtesting and not of just guesswork.**_

## Getting started

EliteMobs currently offers a vast array of configuration options due to high demand for customization. To keep this wiki page concise, only the default configurations will be displayed. 

If you wish to learn more about a specific setting, you can refer to the config file and review the comments.

## config.yml

`config.yml` contains mostly random settings that couldn't comfortably fit elsewhere at the time of creating them. It is the config file most likely to see changes between versions.

## AntiExploit.yml

`AntiExploit.yml` allows admins to customize different aspects of the AntiExploit system. The AntiExploit system exists to prevent players from using things such as mob grinders to easily farm for coins and loot, and pushes them to do real fights and minidungeons instead of afk clicking their way to the top of the plugin.

This is a critical system to keep on if you don't want people to just afk grind the entire plugin and want to actually have them interact with minidungeons.

# Elite Script Actions

Actions are at the core of the script. These determine what the script does and allows you to set custom intervals.

Actions always start with the type of action you are going to do. Different action types serve different functions. Additionally, all actions have a target or targets. Actions can also have a wait timer, to make sure that things happen at customizable delays. Finally, actions can also have several other fields specific to the action type.

### DAMAGE

This is how you can damage entities as other entities.

_Note: this natively uses the EliteMobs damage system! This means that you will see the normal elite armor reduction from strikes. More on this in the multipliers section._

| Values |                            Details                            | Mandatory |
| --- |:-------------------------------------------------------------:| :-: |
| `Target` | [More info here]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md) | ✅ |
| `multiplier` |                       Damage multiplier                       | ✅ |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: DAMAGE
      Target: 
        targetType: NEARBY_PLAYERS
        range: 10
      multiplier: 0.5
```

Sets the damage to be half the amount of base damage the boss would deal to the player, taking damage reductions into account.

</div>

</details>

</div>

#### multiplier

Sets the damage multiplier of the boss for the effect.

**Important**: in order to make powers scale easily and automatically, damage is applied by having the boss hit the player once and multiplying the base damage of the boss with the multiplier.

This means that a multiplier of 1.0 is the same as a normal hit from the boss. 2.0 is a hit 2x the normal strength, and 0.5 is 50% as hard.

### MAKE_INVULNERABLE

Makes a target invulnerable.

| Values |                            Details                            | Mandatory |

### MODIFY_DAMAGE

Modifies the damage dealt to a boss or dealt to players by that boss. This is a special action with a few special requirements.

| Values | Details | Mandatory |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `multiplier` | Damage multiplier. | ✅ |

This action is special and must be in a script that has an event listener for a damage event. The following are valid damage events: `EliteMobDamagedByEliteMobEvent`, `EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent`, `EliteMobDamagedEvent` for events that reduce damage dealt to the boss and `PlayerDamagedByEliteMobEvent` for events that reduce damage dealt to players.

It is highly recommended that you learn how the `hasTag` condition works in order to best use this action. When used correctly, it is possible to make the boss temporarily resist or be weaker to damage, and this can be associated to player buffs, boss location or many other factors.

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: MODIFY_DAMAGE
      multiplier: 2.0
      Conditions:
        hasTags:

        Target:
          targetType: DIRECT_TARGET

### SET_MOB_AI

Sets if the mob has AI. In Minecraft, mobs with no AI will not move and will not attack. They can still get damaged, but damaging them will not result in them getting knocked back.

### SET_MOB_AWARE

Sets if the mob is aware. In Minecraft, mobs that are not aware will not move to new locations and will not attack. They can still get damaged, and they will get knocked back.

As a note, if the mob was already moving to a location when it lose awareness, it will finish going to that location before fully stopping and not moving anymore.

This means you can use unaware mobs to move to defined locations, unlike mobs with no AI.

Spawns fireworks at the boss location offset by x= 1, y= 1.5 and z = 0. Gives the fireworks a velocity of x=.5, y=-.35 and z=1. The fireworks won't flicker nor have trails; power is set to 2, so the fireworks explosion will be delayed by that amount. 

Finally, there are two lists of color lists: list 1 is orange & red and list 2 is yellow & blue. There are two shapes for the fireworks: BALL\_LARGE and STAR. This means that BALL\_LARGE (element 1) will use orange & red colors (list 1) and STAR (element 2) will use yellow & blue colors (list 2).

When the boss is struck, this script will spawn a falling stone block 10 blocks above and 3 blocks next to the boss location. 

Once the block falls, it will run the LandingScriptExample script, which will place a stone block at the location the block landed on.
The block will stay there for 10 seconds (200 ticks) before it disappears.

### SPAWN_PARTICLE

Spawns particles at the target.

**Note: If coverage is not set, then the coverage will be set to 0.3 by default!**

| Values |                            Details                            | Mandatory |
| --- |:-------------------------------------------------------------:| :-: |
| `Target` | [More info here]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md) | ✅ |
| `particles` |           Lists the particles that will be spawned            | ✅ |

#### particles

Particles have their own special settings, which go as follows:

| Values | Details | Default | Special |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `x` | Sets offset of X | 0.01 | (1) |
| `y` | Sets offset of Y | 0.01 | (1) |
| `z` | Sets offset of Z | 0.01 | (1) |
| `amount` | Sets amount of particles spawned | 1 | (1) |
| `speed` | Sets speed of particles | 0.01 | ❌ |
| `particle` | Sets entity type | `FLAME` | [Pick from this list!](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Particle.html) |
| `red` | Sets red value | `255` | (2) |
| `green` | Sets green value | `255` | (2) |
| `blue` | Sets blue value | `255` | (2) |
| `toRed` | Sets final red value | `255` | (3) |
| `toGreen` | Sets final green value | `255` | (3) |
| `toBlue` | Sets final blue value | `255` | (3) |

_(1) If the `amount` is set to 0, `x`, `y` and `z` will set the particle's velocity instead._

_(2) Only for the `REDSTONE`, `DUST_COLOR_TRANSITION`, `SPELL_MOB` and `SPELL_MOB_AMBIENT` `particle`s_

_(3) Only for the `DUST_COLOR_TRANSITION` `particle`_

It is important to note that one SPAWN_PARTICLE script can spawn multiple particles. Each particle can then have its own configuration fields within the SPAWN_PARTICLE action. Here is an example:

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Zone:
      shape: CYLINDER
      radius: 4
      borderRadius: 3
      height: 30
      Target:
        targetType: DIRECT_TARGET
      track: true
    Actions:
    - action: SPAWN_PARTICLE
      Target:
        targetType: ZONE_BORDER
      particles:
        - particle: FLAME
          speed: 0.2
        - particle: SMOKE_NORMAL
          speed: 0.1
      amount: 1
      repeatEvery: 10
```

<div align="center">

![elitescript_actions_particle.jpg](../../../img/wiki/elitescript_actions_particle.jpg)

</div>

This will spawn a cylinder made from flame and smoke particles around the player that damaged the boss.

</div>

</details>

</div>

#### Moving a particle:

It is possible to set a specific speed for a particle, and it works the same way the Spigot API does. This allows scripters to set a particle to go in a specific direction at a specific speed. It is not possible to make particles change direction midway. This effect is used in the flamethrower enchantment and boss power.

To move a particle, set `amount: 0`. This will signal to Minecraft that the `x`, `y` and `z` values are actually a vector. This vector sets the direction toward which your particle will go.

Let's say that you want a `FLAME` particle to go up. To do this, you want a positive `y` value, and nothing else. Finally, you will want to set the velocity to what you want the speed to be. Here is a full example:

          y: 1
          z: 0.5

      repeatEvery: 10
```

This will spawn a flame particle at the boss location that will go up.

</div>

This would teleport all players that are within 10 blocks from the boss to the boss spawn location.

</div>

</details>

</div>

#### location

Sets the location where the player will be teleported. The format is the standard EliteMobs `world_name,x,y,z,pitch,yaw`.

Example

```yaml
location: world,0,64,0,0,0
```

This has a few special values:

- If the world name is set to `same_as_boss`, it will replace the world name with the name of the world the boss is currently in:

```yaml
location: same_as_boss,0,64,0,0,0
```

- If there are only three values matching x, y and z the teleport will be done to a location relative to the boss location. If the boss is a regional boss, the location will be relative to the boss' spawn point.

# Multiple actions

Sometimes you may want to do several actions all at once when an event happens, like sending multiple messages or doing different actions sequentially. This is easily done! Let's add a potion effect action to our example:

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  MessagePlayers:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedEventByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: MESSAGE
      Target:
        targetType: ALL_PLAYERS
      message: I am messaging all online players!
    - action: MESSAGE
      Target:
        targetType: DIRECT_TARGET
      message: I am messaging the player that hit the boss!
```

</div>

</details>

</div>


# Elite Script Conditions

Conditions allow scripters to make scripts and / or actions **not** run based on specific conditions.

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Conditions:
      isAlive: true
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
    Actions:
    - action: PLACE_BLOCK
      Target:
        targetType: DIRECT_TARGET
      duration: 20
      material: DIRT
      offset: 0,3,0
      Conditions:
        locationIsAir: true
        Target:
          targetType: ACTION_TARGET
    Cooldowns:
      local: 60
      global: 20
```

In this example, the `Example` script will only run if the elite is still alive, and will only place a dirt block 3 blocks above the elite location if that block is an air block. Individual actions can have individual conditions.

</div>

</details>

</div>

## Target

Conditions use the [Targets]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md) system to target which entity or location is subjected to the conditions. This means that you can associate conditions to the boss or to players or to anything else you can target.

---

## Condition Type

| Key | Details | Values |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `conditionType` | Sets type of condition | `BLOCKING` / `FILTERING` |

There are two types of condition: `BLOCKING` and `FILTERING`. `BLOCKING` conditions make scripts or actions stop running. `FILTERING` conditions make actions skip over targets that do not meet the condition. This means that if you want to only target block that are not air, you will want a `FILTERING`condition, but if you want to stop an action if a player is dead, you'll want a `BLOCKING` condition.

**Conditions outside of actions are always `BLOCKING`**. Conditions inside of actions can be `BLOCKING` or `FILTERING`.

_**Note: if the target is `SELF` (the boss) and the condition check is `isAlive`, the check is always `BLOCKING`!**_ This can be put inside of a `FILTERING` condition and will still make this specific part behave as `BLOCKING`.

Conditions inside of actions are set to `FILTERING` by default.

---

## Location-based conditions

### locationIsAir

Sets the condition to be whether the location of the target is air.

| Key | Details |       Values        |
| --- | :-: |:-------------------:|
| `locationIsAir` | Sets to check if the location is an air block (or the opposite). | [Boolean](#boolean) |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Conditions:
      locationIsAir: true
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
        offset: "0,3,0"
```

Check if the location 2 blocks above where the boss is standing is air.

</div>

</details>

</div>

---

### isOnFloor

### isStandingOnMaterial

Checks if the location underneath the target is a matching material type.

| Key |                     Details                     |        Values         |
| --- |:-----------------------------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| `isStandingOnMaterial` | Sets which material type should be checked for. | [Material](#material) |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Conditions:
      isStandingOnMaterial: BIRCH_WOOD
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
```

Will only run if the boss is standing on BIRCH_WOOD.

</div>

</details>

</div>

## Entity-based conditions

### isAlive

Sets the condition to be whether the condition target entity is alive.

| Key | Details | Values |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `isAlive` | Sets to check if the entity is alive (or dead). | [Boolean](#boolean) |

<div align="center">

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Conditions:
      isAlive: false
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
```

Will only run if the boss is dead.

</div>

</details>

</div>

---

### hasTags

Checks if the target entity has specific tags. Scripters can assign and unassign any tag through actions and use them as conditions for later behavior. Tags are just strings (words) that you can assign to a boss.

| Key | Details |           Values            |
| --- | :-: |:---------------------------:|
| `hasTags` | Sets to check if the entity has a list of tags. | [String List](#string_list) |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Conditions:
      hasTags:
      - isCool
      - hasANiceBeard
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
```

Will only run if the boss has the tags "isCool" and "hasANiceBeard".

</div>

</details>

</div>


---

### doesNotHaveTags

Same as `hasTags`, but checks if the boss does not have these values.

| Key | Details | Values |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `doesNotHaveTags` | Sets to check if the entity does not have a list of tags. | [String List](#string_list) |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Conditions:
      doesNotHaveTags:
      - isStinky
      - isSus
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
```

Will only run if the boss does not have the tags "isStinky" and "isSus".

</div>

</details>

</div>

## Other conditions

### randomChance

Gives the condition a random chance to be valid.

| Key | Details | Values |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `randomChance` | Chance that the condition will be valid. | Number between 0.0 and 1.0 |

Note that this condition is special as it does not require a target.

# Elite Script Cooldowns

Cooldowns set the amount of time that must pass before the boss is eligible to do a both the same script or any other power\*.

- note: some powers are not currently affected by cooldowns.

Cooldowns have two values:

## local

`local` sets the time, in ticks, before the same script can happen again. Example:

Example

```yaml
local: 60
```

Sets the power to be able to run again for 3 seconds.

## global

`global` sets the time, in ticks, before any other script or power can happen again\[1\]. Example:

Example

```yaml
global: 20
```

Sets all other powers to not be able to start for 1 second.

[1] some of the older powers are currently unaffected by this, it is a work in progress.

**Note: by making the local cooldown longer and the global cooldown shorter, you can guarantee that the boss will alternate between its available powers!** Never make the global cooldown longer, and I recommend leaving at least one second of local cooldown to give other powers a chance to trigger.

Additionally, if your power has a specific duration during which it is active, you should use this system to prevent other powers from running simultaneously and potentially ruining your power.

### Run Scripts Once with Cooldowns
To ensure scripts trigger only once while still using an [Event]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_events.md) that may occur multiple times during a fight, set the local cooldown to a high number, such as `99999`. This example demonstrates the concept:

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  SetMeOnFireOnlyOnce:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent
    Actions:
    - action: SET_ON_FIRE
      duration: 60
      Target:
      targetType: DIRECT_TARGET
    Cooldowns:
    local: 99999
    global: 50
```
In this scenario, the `EliteMobDamagedByPlayerEvent` triggers the `SET_ON_FIRE` action. Without cooldowns, the action would activate every time the player hits the mob. 

However, with a local cooldown set to `99999`, the action will only trigger every `99999` ticks (83 minutes).

</div>

</details>

</div>


# Elite Script Events

EliteScripts are event-based. This means that they are launched when a specific event is triggered. The following are the currently valid events:

| Event | Details | Direct Target [[?]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md)] |

**Note: "Elite" refers to any aggressive entity spawned by the plugin, no matter if they're a reinforcement, a boss or anything else.**
**Note: ZoneEnterEvent and ZoneLeaveEvent are computationally expensive to run so please use these sparingly!**

`Direct Target` is used by the Script Targets, more on that [here]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md).

`ZoneEnterEvent` and `ZoneLeaveEvent` are special events that allow scripters to trigger actions based on entities entering and leaving zones set in scripts. The DIRECT_TARGET of ZoneEnterEvent and ZoneLeaveEvent is the entity that entered or left (this means you can't use the direct target as the target of the zone), and due to how the internal logic works only absolute points (specific coordinates) and points relative to the boss can be used for scanning entering and leaving (cannot use zones that target players).

There can only be one [Event]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_events.md) section per script. However, several events can be set as triggers for a script:

# EliteScript

Elitescript is a scripting system for MagmaGuy's Plugins, providing advanced customization options for creating dynamic behaviors for bosses and other entities in Minecraft. 

Elite Scripts can be added as power files or to custom boss files, offering flexibility in implementation. The scripting involves defining events, conditions, zones, actions, and cooldowns.

# Elite Script Relative Vectors

## What they are for

Relative vectors are vectors that are relative to a specific but dynamic location.

To best explain what these are, let's consider the following case: you want to push a player towards the boss as a part of a power. Since both the boss and the player move around during combat, it is not possible to rely of a specific vector to accomplish this effect - you will need a vector that goes from the player towards the boss. (Imagine a short line with an arrow going from the player towards the boss.)

Relative vectors can be use in so many ways that it would be impossible to list them all, but among them are: shooting entities (like projectiles) towards a specific player or mob; spawning reinforcements behind a player; shooting a falling block in a specific direction; creating rays that are shot towards a player, and so much more.

## How do vectors work?

If you don't know or don't remember what vectors are or how they work, you can think of vectors as arrows that point from one point to another point.

As such, one of the properties of vectors is their length. This length is important; in the case of arrows, this length is the speed at which an arrow is shot, in the case of trying to get offset points from a specific location it is the distance from that point. Things farther away will have greater vector lengths, and closer things will have shorter lengths.

For some mechanics, you will probably not want to rely on how far apart two points are, as you just want to get a direction. Fortunately you are able to use vector normalization, which guarantees that the direction is preserved but changes the length to be 1.0. You can then use multipliers to easily modify the vector until you are satisfied with the offset that it provides or the velocity it gives.

### Order of operations

The order of operations when applying the properties goes as follows:

Vector calculation -> `normalize` -> `multiplier` -> `offset`

# Elite Script Targets

Targets are a central part of Elite Scripts, and are required for Actions and Zones to work.

## Target Types

Target types set what entities or locations get targeted by a script.

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDeathEvent
    Actions:
      - action: MESSAGE
        Target:
          targetType: ALL_PLAYERS
        sValue: "&2Hello World!"
```

This sends a message to the target. Since the target is set to `ALL_PLAYERS`, it will send that message to all online players.

## Shared attributes

The following settings can be applied to all targets.

| Values | Details | Special |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `offset` | Sets the offset for the target location. | Can't target entities! |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:

    Actions
    - action: STRIKE_LIGHTNING
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
        offset: "0,2,0"
```

This strikes lightning 2 blocks above the boss. Note that STRIKE_LIGHTNING uses locations and does not affect entities, so it can have offsets. 

You can't set an offset to send a message, since messages are sent to players. You can, however, set an offset to a zone that can then target entities.

</div>

</details>

## range

Sets the range to scan for nearby players in the `NEARBY_PLAYERS` target type.

| Values | Details | Default |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `range` | Sets the range, in blocks, to scan for player targets. | `20.0` |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:

        Target:
          targetType: NEARBY_PLAYERS
          range: 25.0
        sValue: "&2Targeted players within 25 blocks!"
```

This sends a message to players within 25 blocks of the boss when the boss when the boss dies.

</div>

</details>

</div>

## location

Sets the location for the `LOCATION` target type.

| Values | Details | Default |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `location` | Sets the world location that will be targeted. | `none` |

This uses the format `location: worldname,x,y,z,pitch,yaw` for the location.

**Note that `same_as_boss` is a valid placeholder for the world name, such as `same_as_boss,100,64,100,0,0` would be a valid location that would target the same world as where the boss is.**

<div align="center">

      Target:
        targetType: LOCATION
        location: "myWorld,100,64,200,0,0"
```

This spawns a lighting strike at the location x=100, y=64, z=200 of a world called `myWorld`.

</div>

</details>

## locations

Sets the locations for the `LOCATIONS` target type.

| Values | Details | Default |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `locations` | Sets the list of world locations that will be targeted. | `none` |

This uses the format `worldname,x,y,z,pitch,yaw` for the location.

**Note that `same_as_boss` is a valid placeholder for the world name, such as `same_as_boss,100,64,100,0,0` would be a valid location that would target the same world as where the boss is.**

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  Example:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDeathEvent
    Actions
    - action: STRIKE_LIGHTNING
      Target:
        targetType: LOCATIONS
        locations:
        - "myWorld,100,64,200,0,0"
        - "same_as_boss,-100,12,130,0,0"
```

This spawns a lighting strike at the location x=100, y=64, z=200 of a world called `myWorld` and another lighting strike in the same world as the boss at the location x=-100, y=12 and z=130.

## Targeting zones

[Zones]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md) have multiple targets, and it is important to understand how they work in order to use Elite Scripting to its fullest potential.

Zones work in two parts:

### Part 1 - Setting where the zone goes

Zones need to know where they are supposed to be, and to do that you use the target system the same way you would for any other location-based effect, like a lightning strike.

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  VisualCylinder:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedEvent
    Zone:
      radius: 10.0
      shape: CYLINDER
      height: 1
      filter: PLAYER
      borderRadius: 5.0
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
```

This spawns a cylindrical zone around the boss. Note that no actions are set in this example yet, that is covered below.

Some zones, like [STATIC_RAY]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=static_ray), have two or more targets. This is because rays are lines, and lines are defined by two points. This is covered more extensively in the [zones page]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md), but they fundamentally all work the same way.

</div>

</details>

</div>

### Part 2 - Targeting the inside of the zone

Now that the zone knows where it is, we need the action to know that its target is the zone that we defined. That is what `targetType: ZONE_FULL` and `targetType:ZONE_BORDER` are for.

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  VisualCylinder:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedEvent
    Zone:
      radius: 10.0
      shape: CYLINDER
      height: 1
      filter: PLAYER
      borderRadius: 5.0
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
    Actions:
    - action: SPAWN_PARTICLE
      times: 12
      repeatEvery: 5
      particles:
      - particle: SMOKE_NORMAL
      Target:
        targetType: ZONE_FULL
```

Using the same zone from the first part, we now add the action. The target for this action is `ZONE_FULL`, which means that it will be spawning particles inside of the whole zone.

Note that ZONE_BORDER is not available for every zone. More on that in the [script zones]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md) page.

</div>

</details>

</div>

### Zone track

Sets if the zone will move with the target, such as if the zone will move when the boss moves for `targetType: SELF`.

| Values | Details | Default |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `track` | Sets if the zone will move around with the target. | `true` |

Note that animatable zones can't track. [More on that here.]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=animatable)

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  VisualCylinder:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedEvent
    Zone:
      radius: 10.0
      shape: CYLINDER
      height: 1
      filter: PLAYER
      borderRadius: 5.0
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
    Actions:
    - action: SPAWN_PARTICLE
      times: 12
      repeatEvery: 5
      particles:
      - particle: SMOKE_NORMAL
      Target:
        targetType: ZONE_FULL
        track: false
```

</div>

</details>

</div>

Using the same example from part 1 and part 2, the zone is now set to not track. This means that the zone will spawn at the boss location, but even as the boss keeps moving away, the zone will stay where it first spawned.

Finally, note that if a zone is set to not track, it will register its location at the moment the script is called.

As an example, you want to have a warning phase and a damage phase for your script, you will need to make sure you run all actions at the start and put a wait time on all actions related to damage you want to run later individually. You should not delay a whole script that you call through `RUN_SCRIPT` for technical reasons.

The following is a correct example of a power with a warning and a damage phase taken from the Frost Palace Sanctum.

</div>

</details>

</div>

This script does a lot of things, but it is separated into two clear scripts: `VisualCylinder` and `DamageCylinder`.

VisualCylinder runs first and has the `RUN_SCRIPT` action which immediately also runs the `DamageCylinder` at the same time the `VisualCylinder` is running.

However, every single action in `DamageCylinder` is set to wait for 60 ticks, or 3 seconds.

This means that the boss has a warning phase of 3 seconds, and then does a damage phase, and even though the zones are set not to track the warning zone and the damage zone will be at the same location.

### Zone-specific target properties

Zone have the following specific properties:

#### coverage

Sets the percentage of the zone that will actually be used for the action. Only works for location targets (won't work when targetting players or other entities).

| Values | Details | Default |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| `coverage` | Sets the percentage of the zone that will be covered. | `1.0` |

<div align="center">

<details> 

<summary><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yaml
eliteScript:
  VisualCylinder:
    Events:
    - EliteMobDamagedEvent
    Zone:
      radius: 10.0
      shape: CYLINDER
      height: 1
      filter: PLAYER
      borderRadius: 5.0
      Target:
        targetType: SELF
    Actions:
    - action: SPAWN_PARTICLE
      times: 12
      repeatEvery: 5
      particles:
      - particle: SMOKE_NORMAL
      Target:
        targetType: ZONE_FULL
        track: false
        coverage: 0.5
```

In this case, only 50% of the zone will be covered in particles.

</div>

</details>

</div>

### Inheriting targets

When a script runs another script (or "calls" that script), it is possible to pass zone and target information from the first script to the second.

**Example uses**

1. **Improved script runners**

Script runners are scripts whose only function is to run a lot of other scripts. They are used to make managing scripts easier, especially when handling several scripts that require precise timing.

With target inheritance, several scripts can use the same zone or target, cutting down potentially hundreds of lines of repetitive scripting.

2. **Matryoshka target filtering / Russian nesting doll target filtering**

Filtering conditions can be applied to targets in an action. By passing the targets to a different script with different filters, it becomes possible to layer the conditions and apply different effects to the same pool of targets based in increasingly specific criteria.

As an example, it is possible to create a zone that looks for players and make an action that checks if all players in the zone have a specific tag. The valid targets can then be passed to another script where another action can then run a random check condition and apply an effect based on that chance. The targets can then be further passed along to another script where another condition can do a check to see if the targets are still alive and do some special behavior if they are dead.

These are, of course, just examples. It is a highly flexible system.

3. **Complex zones**

Finally, it is possible to layer targets to create complex zones, optionally using conditions if required, and it is even possible to create semi-randomized zones using the script conditions and the ability to only run one of the listed scripts from the script actions.

**Note:** For this section, **"parent script"** refers to the script that runs the **"inheriting script"**, which is the script which will be using the inherited targets.

When using target inheritance, it is important to take a careful look at the _parent script_ to make sure the correct data is getting passed down.

#### INHERIT_SCRIPT_TARGET

When using `INHERIT_SCRIPT_TARGET`, the targets from the _parent script_ will be passed down to the inheriting script. This has a couple of caveats:

- When passing **entity targets**, it is possible to run actions that require locations (such as spawning particles) as the location of the entities will be used. It is, of course, also possible to use actions which require entities.

- When passing **location targets**, is it only possible to use locations. **The only way to get an entity from a locations is by creating a zone at that location and looking for entities.** So, while it is not impossible to pass a location and then get entities, it will require a little bit of extra work.


#### Inheriting zones

When using `INHERIT_SCRIPT_ZONE_FULL` or `INHERIT_SCRIPT_ZONE_BORDER`, it is imperative that the _parent script_ defines a zone, or else the _inheriting script_ will not be able to run correctly.

Additionally zones can optionally be [tracked]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md&section=zone-track). This will also be passed along with the zone.

- An **untracked** zone will always create a zone where defined by the _inheriting script_. This means that the zone settings will be used by the actions in the _inheriting scripts_ to create brand new zones every time an action runs, and the location of those zones will be defined by the action.

- A **tracked** zone can pass the same exact zone location to all _inheriting scripts_ if the _parent script_ is set to target `ZONE_FULL` or `ZONE_BORDER`. This means that every script will be acting on the same locations.

# Elite Script Zones

Zones are locations defined by a shape that can be used as targets by scripters to run any kind of action.

Only one zone can be set per script.

To target zones, the target type `ZONE_FULL` or `ZONE_BORDER` can be used.

Zones themselves also use [Script Targets]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_targets.md) to define were the zone will appear.

## shape

Sets the shape of the zone. Valid shapes:

| Shape Type                                                               | Details | Animatable | Border |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [`CYLINDER`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=cylinder)         | Cylindrical shape | ❌ | ✅ |
| [`SPHERE`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=sphere)             | Spherical shape | ❌ | ✅ |
| [`DOME`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=dome)                 | Dome shape (half sphere) | ❌ | ✅ |
| [`CUBOID`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=cuboid)             | Cuboid shape (cube-like) | ❌ | ✅ |
| [`STATIC_RAY`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=static_ray)     | A fixed line between two points | ❌ | ❌ |
| [`ROTATING_RAY`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=rotating_ray) | A rotating line between two points | ✅ | ❌ |
| [`TRANSLATING_RAY`]($language$/elitemobs/elitescript_zones.md&section=translating_ray) | A line that moves between two initial points to two final points | ✅ | ❌ |

---

#### Animatable

Zones with animations start the zone animation when the script is first called.

This means that if an action has a wait time, when the action starts the zone has already been moving around while the action was waiting.

Zones are always animated on every tick. This means that if you use the `SPAWN_PARTICLES` action, you can set it to run every tick as the zone will be moving every tick. If you run every second, you will see the particles jumping around as the zone kept moving even on ticks where particles were not spawned.

If you want to make a rotating zone action but want to wait for a set amount of ticks before starting the action, make that a different script and call that script through `RUN_SCRIPT`. Make sure the `RUN_SCRIPT` has the wait time you want.

Zones will stay at the final location once they are done animating.

All animatable zones are set to not track on the script targets since the extra movement would make things too hard to understand for scripters and players. This means that these zones will not follow bosses or players around and will always move relative to their initial spawn points.

---

#### Border

Certain zones can have borders. Borders mean that `ZONE_BORDER` can be used as the target of the zone. Borders are defined by creating a second, smaller shape inside the first, larger shape. The area between the smaller zone and the larger zone is the border.

This script makes smoke particles that **only** appear in the zone border for 5 seconds (repeat every 5 x times 20 = 100 ticks).

If you did not use the `ZONE_BORDER` option but the `ZONE_FULL` option instead then the entire zone would be covered in smoke particles like this:

First, it creates a ray from the boss to the player who harmed it, using cloud particles. 

Then, it animates the ray to go upwards 10 blocks from both targets using the `offset` on the `FinalTarget1` and `FinalTarget2`.

The animation takes 5 seconds (100 ticks) to complete.

We can easily make the ray move sideways by adjusting the Z `offset`  to something like `offset: 0,0,10`:

# Setup and Installation FAQ

### How do I set up custom models?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

There are two different plugins that handle "Custom Models".

- LibsDisguises (including the free edition) lets you disguise mobs as other mobs or as custom player skins. If you see a Custom Boss with a player disguise on it, it is using LibsDisguises for the disguise. You will have to download LibsDisguises to get this specific feature to work.


- FreeMinecraftModels (and ModelEngine R3, although ModelEngine is no longer recommended) lets you disguise mobs as any Custom Model, with very few limitations. FreeMinecraftModels lets you do this for free and is recommended. You will have to either use FreeMinecraftModels or ModelEngine R3 (not R4) for Custom Models to work. FreeMinecraftModels can be run alongside ModelEngine, so you can also just run both.
<br>If you have installed FreeMinecraftModels/ModelEngine and the Custom Models are still not working, you may have installed the content before you installed the model plugin. To make sure this isn't an issue, reimport the EliteMobs content with the Custom Disguises and install it again.

</details>

### Console / EliteMobs says I'm using the wrong WorldGuard version

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

If WorldGuard is reported by EliteMobs as not being installed, that is because you are using the wrong WorldGuard version for your server platform. WorldGuard is very sensitive about which version you are using, and have different version for server software.

- You can download the WorldGuard version for Spigot / Paper from here: https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard - Make sure that it says it that it is compatible with your Minecraft version!

</details>

### Wormholes / Arenas / NPCs don't seem to be working correctly immediately after installation

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

If wormholes / arenas / NPCs don't seem to be working correctly immediately after installing content, you should run `/em reload`. It is always good to run it after installing EliteMobs content.

</details>

### Dungeon Bosses are not reappearing after killing them

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Most of the time, this is just because some bosses have long respawn times. The Shadow of the Binder of Worlds has the longer respawn timer of 1 real life week. Lair bosses usually have a 4 hour respawn timer. Everything else tends to be on a 5-30 minute respawn timer. You can edit a Custom Boss' respawn timer in their configuration file in the `~/plugins/EliteMobs/custombosses` folder.

</details>

### Dungeon Bosses never appeared after installation

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

This is almost certainly due to a third party plugin's interference. Check the following:
- Is your world on Peaceful difficulty? Mobs don't spawn on Peaceful difficulty


- Is your region protected against spawning? EliteMobs dungeons handle their own region protection via WorldGuard, you don't need to protect EliteMobs dungeon worlds, actually doing so may prevent spawning if the wrong flags are used.


- Is there another plugin preventing EliteMobs bosses from spawning or removing them? These conflicts will often show up in console, so check your console logs.

</details>

### The plugin isn't autocompleting commands for content I just installed

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Autosuggestions in commands are handled by CloudCommandFramework and only updates command suggestions **after a server restart**. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about that.

</details>

### How do I use the EliteMobs translations?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

You can change EliteMob's language by running the `/em language <languagename>.yml`. to use the default plugin translation created and managed by the EliteMobs community

To add a language that is not in the plugin, or to customize the existing language, it is recommended you use `custom_language.yml`.

Language files only generate their contents when you switch the language!

If you break the formatting of the yml file, which is very easy to do by mistake, it will reset the file! ***Make sure you keep a local backup of your translation if you are manually translating the content!***

It is easier to translate the language file in the community translation website, as that handles formatting for you! It also automatically suggests translations. You can find that here: https://crowdin.com/project/elitemobs

As a reminder, if you're translating, if you use special characters such as `&` to start a configuration value, you must put that value between quotes like \"&cCool value\"! Otherwise, the file will be broken, and it will reset your progress. You can use a linter to check yml file validity - just paste your yml contents here: <https://www.yamllint.com/>

# EliteMobs and BetterStructures compatibility FAQ

### Can I get structures in BetterStructure with bosses from EliteMobs in them?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Yes, the BetterStructures shrine packages are exactly this kind of content. You can download the shrine packs from [itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/).

</details>

### Why are the shrines protected with WorldGuard and how do I prevent that

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

The EliteMobs shrine structures are protected with WorldGuard by default to make sure that players don't build contraptions to abuse the Minecraft combat system inside the fighting area.

The protections automatically get deleted once the boss is defeated.

Every shrine has entry points that players must dig around to find if they are underground.

If you do not wish to use WorldGuard protections, you can disable it in the BetterStructures config.yml configuration file.

</details>

### Why are the shrines spawning without elites in them?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

This can happen if you install the BetterStructures shrines before you install EliteMobs. To fix this, reimport and reinstall the shrines into you server **after** EliteMobs is installed.

</details>

### Can I use the shrines without using EliteMobs

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

The shrines were made specifically for combating the bosses that are in them, but if you just want the combat arenas for the aesthetics, you can just run the shrine packages without having EliteMobs installed.

</details>

# EliteMobs and FreeMinecraftModels compatibility FAQ

### Is FreeMinecraftModels compatible with EliteMobs?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Yes. the FreeMinecraftModels plugin was made specifically around EliteMobs and EternalTD.

</details>

### How do I install EliteMobs custom models?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

You can download the custom models for EliteMobs from https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy and https://magmaguy.itch.io/. Once you have them installed, **you will have to merge the resource pack** generated by FreeMinecraftModels in its output folder with the official resource pack from EliteMobs if you want to use the official resource pack and distribute that to players by hosting it online.

# EliteMobs and ResurrectionChest compatibility FAQ

### Does EliteMobs work with ResurrectionChest?

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Yes. ResurrectionChest was made specifically for EliteMobs content and is fully compatible.

</details>

# Compatibility with other plugins FAQ

### Can I use EliteMobs with a plugin similar to MCMMO or AureliumSkills

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Yes. That being said, you might want to disable the bonus health from the EliteMobs prestige system.

</details>

### Can I use EliteMobs with another custom items plugin

<details>
<summary>
Info
</summary>

Yes. If you want bosses to drop specific items from that plugin, you set on death commands to run and give players items that way. However, there is no real way to balance EliteMobs with whatever item system you are using. Elites go from having 7 health points to hundreds of thousands of health points, and as such other item plugins will either be insanely overpowered of incredibly underpowered. EliteMobs already has an item system built into it and does not require any external items plugin.

</details>

# Other FAQ

### Run a command on Elite Mob death or give loot/rewards from other plugins on Elite Mob death?

[Information available here.]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=ondeathcommands)

### Vault support?

[Information available here.]($language$/elitemobs/vault.md)

### PlaceholderAPI placeholders?

[Information available here.]($language$/elitemobs/placeholders.md)

### Use WorldGuard flags to allow EliteMobs in some places but not others?

[Information available here.]($language$/elitemobs/worldguard_flags.md)

### Can I make 100% of mobs that spawn be Elite Mobs?

This is a terrible idea but, you can access the `MobCombatSettings.yml` configuration file and
edit `eliteMobsSpawnPercentage` to set Elite Mobs spawn percentage.

### Can I create custom powers?

[Information available here.]($language$/elitemobs/creating_powers.md)

### Can I create custom enchantments?

This is on our to do list and should be coming soon, but it is currently not possible.

### Can I create custom potion effects?

The only way to do this is to learn Java and write them yourself. At that point, you might as well modify the
EliteMobs source code.

### How can I turn off wormhole particles?

To turn of the wormhole particles navigate to *~plugins\EliteMobs\Wormholes.yml* and then locate `noParticlesMode` and
change the value to `false`.

### How can I edit the wormhole in AG spawn to teleport players where I want?

<div align="center">

![faq_ag_wormhole.jpg](../../../img/wiki/faq_ag_wormhole.jpg)

</div>

You can do so by opening up *plugins\EliteMobs\wormholes\adventurers_guild_wormhole.yml*.

Then find the following setting
`location2: your_world_here,0.5,64,0.5,0,0`
and change the values to your preferred location.

Remember to do `/em reload` for the changes to take effect.

### How can I unbind items?

The only way to remove soulbound from items is to use Unbind Scrolls. Read more about
that [here]($language$/elitemobs/soulbind.md).

### How can I merge resource packs?

It is possible to merge resource packs manually, but we recommend using an online tool such as [merge.elmakers](https://merge.elmakers.com/) to merge your resource packs.

### What are the EliteMobs command placeholders?

| Placeholder |          Details           |
| --- |:--------------------------:|
| `$player` | Display name of the player |
| `$bossName` |  Display name of the boss  |
| `$bossLevel` |     Level of the boss      |

### What do I do to turn off force resource pack?

This setting is actually located in your `server.properties` file. You can usually find this file in your servers root directory. After opening up the file locate the `require-resource-pack` setting and change the value to `false` to turn off force resource pack.

### How can I turn off events?

If you would like to turn off events such as the weapons goblin, charms goblin etc. Then you can open up *~plugins\EliteMobs\events.yml* then locate the settings `actionEventsEnabled`, `timedEventsEnabled` and set them to `false`.

- You can use [WorldGuard]($language$/elitemobs/worldguard_flags.md) to set where in the world Elite Mobs can spawn, can't spawn, where non-elites can and can't spawn, where the antiexploit system doesn't apply, set minimum and maximum levels for elites spawned there and set areas where EliteMobs events can't happen.
- You can use PlaceholderAPI ([PAPI]($language$/elitemobs/placeholders.md)) to connect various EliteMobs elements to things like chat, scoreboard and so on.
- You can use [DiscordSRV]($language$/elitemobs/discordsrv.md) to post EliteMobs announcements on your discord server, like specific World Boss spawns or deaths.
- Some bosses spawn based on player [events]($language$/elitemobs/elitemobs+creating_events.md&section=what-are-custom-events?), like mining.
- Some bosses spawn based on server [events]($language$/elitemobs/elitemobs+creating_events.md&section=what-are-custom-events?), like a meteor crashing into the world.
- EliteMobs has an NPC System ([Learn more here]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md)) which allows you to force players to trade only through NPCs instead of using commands.
- **There are [EliteMobs Lairs and Minidungeons]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md) you can download on discord for free and even more on Patreon**
- EliteMobs fully supports [Instanced Dungeons]($language$/elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md&section=instanced-dungeoneering), complete with full difficulty and class role support.
- You can use the [Adventurer's Guild]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md) world as a hub for EliteMobs NPCs, it sets itself up automatically if uploaded to your server (not a replacement for your overworld!).
- There are dynamic quests to kill Elites.
- There is a [guild system]($language$/elitemobs/guild_tier_loot_limiter.md) which players progress through to get better gear and rewards like increased max health and chance to dodge.
- The guild system has a [prestige system]($language$/elitemobs/prestige_system.md) which allows players to unlock more ranks and better rewards in exchange for losing all of their EliteMobs progress so far.
- Gear is limited by the guild rank by default, encouraging people to interact more with challenging mechanics.
- There is an antiexploit system which prevents players from easily farming gear by exploiting terrain.
- The trails around procedurally generated Elite Mobs indicates what powers they have.
- Higher level Elites have more, stronger [powers]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=easy-configuration---premade-powers).
- The higher your gear, the higher the level of the elite spawned, the higher the level of the gear it drops.
- All player commands are centralized in the /em command, meaning players don't have to remember any commands other than that one.
- EliteMobs uses the permissionless mode by default, which requires no further setup from admins for the plugin to basically work (though the AG world and the dungeons are strongly recommended).
- EliteMobs was 100% developed by one guy. Send help. Preferably in the form of caffeine. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy) is fine too.


# Guild Tier Limiter

The guild tier loot limiter limits the best loot a player can loot based on their guild tier. 

Players can unlock higher tiers by going to the Adventurer's Guild hub and talking to Gillian the Guild Attendant NPC or by running the */em rank* command. Ranks are unlocked by purchasing them with Elite Coins.

By default, players are limited in the following ways (assuming you're using the default settings):

- Guild tier 1 (starting default): up to tier 10 items, level 10 mobs
- Guild tier 2: up to tier 20 items, level 20 mobs
- Guild tier 3: up to tier 30 items, level 30 mobs
- Guild tier 4: up to tier 40 items, level 40 mobs
- Guild tier 5: up to tier 50 items, level 50 mobs
- Guild tier 6: up to tier 60 items, level 60 mobs
- Guild tier 7: up to tier 70 items, level 70 mobs
- Guild tier 8: up to tier 80 items, level 80 mobs
- Guild tier 9: up to tier 90 items, level 90 mobs
- Guild tier 10: up to tier 100 items, level 100 mobs

From point on, prestige levels are required in order to unlock the guild tiers.

- Prestige 1 Guild tier 11: up to tier 110 items, level 110 mobs
- Prestige 2 Guild tier 12: up to tier 120 items, level 120 mobs
- Prestige 3 Guild tier 13: up to tier 130 items, level 130 mobs
- Prestige 4 Guild tier 14: up to tier 140 items, level 140 mobs
- Prestige 5 Guild tier 15: up to tier 150 items, level 150 mobs
- Prestige 6 Guild tier 16: up to tier 160 items, level 160 mobs
- Prestige 7 Guild tier 17: up to tier 170 items, level 170 mobs
- Prestige 8 Guild tier 18: up to tier 180 items, level 180 mobs
- Prestige 9 Guild tier 19: up to tier 180 items, level 190 mobs
- Prestige 10 Guild tier 20: up to tier 200 items, level 200 mobs

## How this works & edge cases
Since the guild tier limits the tier of the item that players can kill, this means that players can only spawn mobs up to a certain level as the level of the mob is based on the gear the player is wearing. Should players go hunt mobs with higher level friends, the loot that they will get will be of a lower level than their friends'. 

Combined with the [soulbind]($language/elitemobs/soulbind.md$) enchantment, this curbs the issue of powerleveling quite a bit and allows admins to not have to worry about visitors reaching the maximum tier within a few minutes of joining the server / new players instantly getting loads of diamond tier items. Additionally, it gives players a deeper connection with their loot, as it makes it belong to them and only them.

# Versions

Starting with EliteMobs version 9.0.0, the only supported Minecraft version is 1.21 and above.

For those seeking compatibility with older Minecraft versions (1.19.4 - 1.20.4), please use EliteMobs version 8.

**Note: No version of EliteMobs supports Minecraft versions 1.20.5 and 1.20.6.**

# What is EliteMobs for?

EliteMobs aims to extend the end-game of Minecraft by implementing various boss-related content.

This means:
- Dynamic Bosses (Leveled Mobs)
- Custom Bosses
- Events
- Arenas
- World Based Dungeons
- Instanced Dungeons
- Open-World Random Dungeons (with BetterStructures integration)
- Custom Items (Elite Items/Loot)
- ... and more! 

The plugin does not aim to replace vanilla Minecraft content but rather complement it, allowing players to opt-out of EliteMobs content if desired. EliteMobs items typically do not affect PvP or vanilla Minecraft combat, as their damage and defense bonuses only apply during combat with EliteMobs.

# EliteMobs Feature Overview

In this section we will take a look at the some of the **major** features EliteMobs has to offer, what they are and how you can disable them. For a full feature list see [this page]($language$/elitemobs/feature_list.md&section=feature-list).

You can also check out [this]($language$/elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md) page to find the intended way the players are supposed to interact with EliteMobs.

## Dynamic Bosses

Dynamic Bosses is one of the main features of EliteMobs. It replaces a percentage of vanilla Minecraft spawns with Elite Mob spawns.

Elites are tougher mobs designed to challenge players and reward them with possible loot drops upon defeat. The level of Elites is determined by the quality of armor and gear equipped by the player. Normal Minecraft gear has a level determined by the material quality, as explained [here]($language$/elitemobs/spawning_tiers_loot.md&section=material-levels). However, as players defeat Elites and acquire better loot, they will eventually start obtaining Elite items with set levels, making it easier to predict the levels of Elites that will spawn.

This implies that player levels are determined by the gear they wear, while Elite levels are determined by the players' levels.
There is no experience system in EliteMobs, all player level progression is dependent on gear.

You can adjust the difficulty of elites by modifying the `damageToEliteMobMultiplierV2` and `damageToPlayerMultiplierV2` values in *MobCombatSettings.yml*. More information on this can be found [here]($language$/elitemobs/elitemobs_config_settings.md&section=mobcombatsettings.yml).

If you wish to disable this feature entirely, you can do so by setting the `doNaturalEliteMobSpawning` value to `false`.

## Elite Items/Loot

EliteMobs features randomly generated items that can be found in shops or be dropped by Elites. There also custom items that are usually found in dungeons and other Elite content.

Elite items are just like vanilla items except they are usually equipped with extra goodies and are more powerful than anything you can find in vanilla MineCraft. Some Elite items will have stats on them that are called **Elite Sharpness** and **Elite Defense**, these stats will only apply when players are fighting Elites and do not affect vanilla mobs.

Elite items can also have enchantments, [Custom Enchantments]($language$/elitemobs/custom_enchantments_list.md) and potion effects.

You can disable Elite items by opening up *ItemSettings.yml* and setting the `doEliteMobsLoot` value to `false`. (Not recommended, makes MMORPG level progression impossible.)

## Events

Events are unique encounters in EliteMobs that can trigger randomly based on a timer or by specific player actions, such as mining a block or chopping a tree. 

These encounters feature custom, unique Elites that pose a greater challenge and offer valuable loot upon defeat. 

Players receive notifications in the chat when an event occurs, with the option to track the Elite's health and location via a clickable link. If the Elite is not defeated within a certain time frame, the event ends and the Elite despawns.

You can disable all events by opening events.yml and setting the values actionEventsEnabled and timedEventsEnabled to false.

If you would like to disable individual events you can go to ~plugins\EliteMobs\customevents. there you will find configs for each event and you can disable any event by opening its config and setting the value isEnabled to false.

## Adventurer's Guild

The Adventurer's Guild is an additional hub world that you can install and it is also a set of commands that the players can use.

If the hub world is not installed then the players will have to use commands, otherwise running commands with the hub world installed will teleport players to the hub world and there they can interact with NPCs instead of having to type in commands.

What commands? EliteMobs has several commands that players can use to sell and buy items, repair items, enchant items and more. Learn more about which commands the players can use [here]($language$/elitemobs/permissions_and_commands.md&section=npc-commands).

For more information on the Adventurer's Guild and how to install the hub world check out [this]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md) page.

You can disable the hub world by opening up *AdventurersGuild.yml* and setting the `guildHubIsEnabledv2` to `false`.

## Guild Tier/Rank

As players progress and acquire better items they will eventually hit a limit and mobs will stop dropping higher level items, this is called the guild tier loot limiter.

The guild tier loot limiter restricts the highest loot players can obtain based on their guild tier and applies default limitations from tier 1 to tier 10 items, with corresponding mob levels. Prestige levels unlock higher tiers, allowing access to superior loot and tougher mobs, ensuring balanced gameplay. 

This system, combined with the soulbind enchantment, mitigates powerleveling issues, maintains server balance, and fosters player attachment to their acquired loot. You can read more about guild tier [here]($language$/elitemobs/guild_tier_loot_limiter.md).

All settings for the Guild Tier can be adjusted and are located in *AdventurersGuild.yml*.

</div>

## Arenas

Arenas are wave-based challenges where players can engage in combat. One or multiple players can join an arena and face increasingly difficult waves of enemies, with rewards improving as the challenge progresses. 

Upon installing the Adventurer's Guild hub world, players gain access to the Wood League Arena, a free arena accessible via interaction with an NPC in the hub world or through the */em* menu.

You can get additional arenas by going to: [Itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) or by subscribing on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy).

You can disable arenas by going to *~plugins\EliteMobs\customarenas*
and then opening up the arena config, for example *wood_league.yml* and then finding the value `isEnabled` and setting it to `false`.

## World Dungeons

World Dungeons are additional custom content that you can download for EliteMobs. Dungeons usually have custom Elite bosses, custom worlds, custom loot and custom boss powers.


All world dungeons are dungeons that are located in their own world, meaning that when the players access them they are teleported to a world that has nothing in it but that dungeon.

There are several types of world dungeons, to learn more about types click [here]($language$/elitemobs/dungeon_packager.md&section=dungeonsizecategory).

All world dungeon have a set level and any players attempting the dungeons should be around that level for the best experience.

You can get dungeons by going to: [Itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) or by subscribing on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy). There are several free dungeons that you can download from [here](https://magmaguy.itch.io/em-free-content).

You can disable individual dungeons by going to *~plugins\EliteMobs\dungeonpackages* and opening up the dungeon config for the dungeon you wish to disable and setting the `isEnabled` value to `false`.

## Instanced Dungeons

Instanced Dungeons differ from World Dungeons in several ways. They are instanced, meaning a new world is dynamically created from a blueprint, providing players and their friends with a private dungeon experience similar to those found in MMOs. 

Instanced Dungeons offer various difficulties with unique boss powers, increased health, and superior loot as the difficulty rises. They also introduce roles, allowing players to adopt tank or DPS roles based on their equipped gear (role-specific gear is exclusive to Instanced Dungeons). Read more about how difficulty works [here]($language$/elitemobs/instanced_dungeon_difficulty.md).

Additionally, players can resurrect each other within Instanced Dungeons, enabling them to swiftly resume the battle if they act fast enough.

You can get instanced dungeons by going to: [Itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) or by subscribing on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy). There are free instanced dungeons that you can download from [here](https://magmaguy.itch.io/em-free-content).

You can disable individual dungeons by going to *~plugins\EliteMobs\dungeonpackages* and opening up the dungeon config for the dungeon you wish to disable and setting the `isEnabled` value to `false`.

## Adventures

Adventures represent the most expansive additional content available for EliteMobs, boasting a vast world complete with a captivating storyline and a multitude of quests for players to embark on. 

Featuring hundreds of custom bosses, powers, and items, Adventures offer an immersive gaming experience. Quests within Adventures function similarly to those in traditional MMOs, tasking players with objectives such as defeating mobs, locating items, interacting with NPCs, or any combination thereof.

Adventures are so big that they even have other sub-dungeons or sub-arenas located within.

While Adventures typically recommend a set level range for players, it's advised for players to begin their adventure at the lower end of the level scale for optimal enjoyment.

You can get adventures by going to: [Itch.io](https://magmaguy.itch.io/) or by subscribing on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy).

You can disable individual adventures by going to *~plugins\EliteMobs\dungeonpackages* and opening up the config for the adventure you wish to disable and setting the `isEnabled` value to `false`. Adventures can have additional sub-dungeons and sub-arenas that come with adventures so make sure you disable those as well if you are disabling an adventure.

## Wormhole Teleports

EliteMobs also features simple from A to B teleporters called wormholes. You will see these mostly used in the Adventurer's Guild hub world as a way to teleport players from there to a dungeon or back to server spawn.

They are usually in the shape of a hexagon, cube or a diamond made out of particles. These particles can sometimes cause lag to bedrock clients, so you might want to disable the particle effects by opening up *Wormholes.yml* and setting `noParticlesMode` to `true`.

You can make your own wormholes and use them however you wish. Click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_wormholes.md) to find out how.

## Custom Content

EliteMobs also offers you the opportunity to create your own content, including [bosses]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md), [dungeons]($language$/elitemobs/dungeon_packager.md), [powers]($language$/elitemobs/creating_powers.md), [NPCs]($language$/elitemobs/creating_npcs.md), [quests]($language$/elitemobs/creating_quests.md), [arenas]($language$/elitemobs/creating_arenas.md), and much more! You can find guides for creating other types of content than the ones listed above in the wiki's sidebar menu.

For the easiest and most efficient content creation experience, we recommend using the WebApp. This tool enables you to generate ready-to-use configuration files without the need to extensively browse through the wiki to ensure correctness, particularly if you're considering creating EliteScript boss powers. Access the [WebApp here](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html).

# For Admins & Server Owners

This plugin is designed for survival and survival-like servers (such as Skyblock, Skywars, and heavily modded survival variants).

The plugin is intended to be easily usable by simply dragging and dropping the plugin jar into the server. The default settings are the ones I use on my own servers and are subject to change over time.

**However!** Customizability has been a top priority throughout the development process of EliteMobs. Almost every aspect of the plugin can be translated, customized, disabled, or modified.


# For other developers

Despite the GPLV3 and open-source nature of this project, I am neither looking for nor will I accept any code additions or changes at this time. I welcome forks of the plugin, and would take immense pleasure to see what you might do with them; however, this is my first massive programming project and as such is also a learning experience.

**However!** Do not take this as me claiming I am beyond any criticism or that I won't listen to feedback - quite the opposite, I love it when people point out better ways of accomplishing things I've done in the plugin. I wish for this project to be something that I wrote end to end, with no code snippets that I am not aware of or that I don't understand.


Instanced dungeons have a special setting to easily define different difficulties for the dungeon.

# How it works

Difficulties are modeled in part after Final Fantasy 14's level sync system.

Elite armor and weapons get specific elite damage and elite defense based on their level, as you can see on items. When in an instanced dungeon with a difficulty on, the level of item will be temporarily and invisibly lowered to match the level sync.

Here is a specific example: a level 100 sword does 100 damage unenchanted. If a player is in an instanced dungeon with a difficulty that level syncs gear to level 50, the sword will act as a level 50 sword and do 50 damage.

However, if that sword has level 10 sharpness, it will still add the same amount of damage on top of the base damage.

This means that, in instanced dungeons with difficulties, what matters is not so much the level of the gear but the quality of the gear. Players seeking to beat the mythic difficulty will have to work towards getting high quality items from other instanced dungeons and possibly heavily interact with the item upgrade system.

This also makes it nearly impossible for veteran players to stomp on old high-difficulty content and provides an incentive to do it even if their level is well beyond the level of the dungeon.

# Party system

To account for player parties, bosses are designed with specific powers which get more dangerous as more players join the arena. Additionally, bosses get a non-linear health boost amount as more players join the instance.

# How to define a difficulty

Difficulties are defined in the `dungeonpackager` folder in the dungeon package file of instanced dungeons.

Let's take a look at an example:

```yml
difficulties:
- levelSync: 60
  name: normal
- levelSync: 50
  name: hard
- levelSync: 40
  name: mythic
```

This sets three difficulties. Difficulties have two mandatory optional fields, `name` and `levelSync`. 

The name is the name of the difficulty, as will appear in the difficulty setting in-game. This can have any name.

The level sync sets the item level cap for the instanced dungeon, as explained above in this page.

You can have as many or as few difficulties defined as you want. Simply add or remove entries to the difficulties setting using the same format.


## Powers based on difficulty

It is possible to configure bosses to only have powers at specific difficulties.  Let's look at an example:

```yml
powers:
- filename: invulnerability_fire.yml
  difficultyID:
  - 1
  - 2
```

**Note: this is a part of the configuration file of the custom boss!**

In this case, the boss will only have fire invulnerability for difficulties with the ID `1` and `2`.

*When adding difficulties, their ID's will start counting from 0 and increase as you add more difficulties.*

## Loot based on difficulty

It is possible to configure bosses to drop loot specific to an instanced dungeon difficulty. Let's look at an example:

```yml
uniqueLootList:
- filename: himiko_boss_drop_axe_tank_normal.yml
  chance: 0.05
  difficultyID: 0
```


**Note: this is a part of the configuration file of the custom boss!**

In this case, the boss will only drop the loot `himiko_boss_drop_axe_tank_normal.yml` for difficulty `0` and has 5% chance of doing so.

As of EliteMobs 7.3.0, it is possible for players to interact with Elite Items in a number of unique ways. This page is meant to help players and admins figure out how the systems work, and later explain the balance of the system for admins.


***

# Unbinding Items

If you have an item unbind scroll, you are able to use the Unbinder NPC to combine 1 scroll with 1 item in order to unbind it.

***Note: as of writing this, there is no way for players to get the scroll without being given or adding it to as specific boss. The scroll will drop from the Ender Dragon fight which will be released this month.***

The scroll can only be used once. Once unbound, items can be sold or given to other players, or be used after a prestige.

***

# Scrapping Items

Elite Items can be scrapped at the Scrapper NPC. When scrapping items depending on the level of the item you will get the following scrap:

- Level 0-50: Tiny Scrap.
- Level 50-100: Small Scrap.
- Level 100-150: Medium Scrap.
- Level 150-200: Huge Scrap.

Scrap is the basis for the rest of the Item System.

***

# Repairing Elite Items

Elite items can be repaired at the Repairman NPC using scrap. The extent of damage to your item determines the quantity and size of scrap required to fix it.

***

# Enchanting Elite Items

Before we proceed to describe how to enchant items, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the items required for enchanting and understand their functions.

**Elite Item**
</br>An elite item encompasses any loot available in the EliteMobs shops, dropped by Elite Mobs, or received as a reward for completing a quest, among other sources.

**Enchanted Books**
</br>Enchanted books are typically dropped by Elite Mobs or bestowed upon players as rewards in Arenas or Quests. They contain enchantments that players can transfer to their desired items.

**Lucky Tickets**
</br>Lucky tickets, usually obtained from Elite Mobs or as rewards in Arenas or Quests, enable players to double their chances of success when enchanting items.

The players can access the enchantment menu by visiting the Enchanter NPC in the [Adventurer's Guild]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md) or by using the `/em` menu.
 
With both an Elite Item and an Enchanted Book, players can attempt to add the enchantment stored in the book to their item. Each attempt will cost the players some Elite Coins. They can also double their chances by using a Lucky Ticket if they have one.

To begin the enchantment the players would place one Elite Item, one Enchanted Book and one Lucky Ticket (If they have one) in the Enchantment window and then try to enchant their item. After that they would be met with one of the following results: 

- **Success:** The enchantment is successfully added to the item.
- **Failure:** Unsuccessful attempt, resulting in the loss of the Enchanted Book and Elite Coins.
- **Critical Failure:** A more severe failure, leading to the loss of the Enchanted Book, Elite Coins, and the Elite Item itself.
- **Challenge:** Engage in a Boss Battle with a 10% chance of critical failure upon losing. The item is enchanted if the players win.

### itemType

Sets where you can obtain the item from. You can set this to `custom` if you want your book to be dropped by random elites and sold in shops. 

Otherwise you can set it to `unique` to have it only drop from configured loot tables.

| Key         |    Values    | Default |

<summary><b>Enchanted Book Config Example</b></summary>

```yml

material: BOOK
name: '&5Excellent Mining Enchanted Book'
lore:
- '&2Used to enchant items at the enchanter!'
enchantments:
- MENDING,1
- DRILLING,1
itemType: UNIQUE
soulbound: false
```

As you can see making your Enchanted Books is not that complicated. Most of the settings are regular settings you would use when creating an [item]($language$/elitemobs/creating_items.md).

Except that of course here our main focus would be the `enchantments` section. Our example book has one MineCraft enchantment `MENDING` and one EliteMobs enchantment `DRILLING`.

This would make our example book an excellent book you would want to use on a pickaxe.

# What's LibsDisguises?

LibsDisguises is a plugin that allows servers to disguise any entity as any other type of entity. As an example, you can disguise players as sheep, or disguise sheep as players.

There is a [free](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) and a [premium](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises.32453/) version to LibsDisguises. LibsDisguises was created and is maintained by other developers, so please don't ask for support for it in EliteMobs support sections.

# How can I disguise an entity as a player?

To disguise a custom boss (or a regional boss, or even an NPC!) as a player, all you need to do is add the following line to the boss config file:

```yml
disguise: player:name
```

As an example, if you want to disguise a boss as my player's skin, the configuration line would look like:

```yml
disguise: player:magmaguy
```

# How can I disguise an entity as a player skin, but not necessarily a player?

This is the most flexible way of disguising an entity as a player, as it allows admins to use online skins or even create their own to disguise a boss. It is also a little bit more complex to do.

For the sake of simplicity, the examples listed here assume you are going to use a skin available online. Libsdisguises provides different ways of deserializing skins, including one where you put your own custom skin in their folder. Check their documentation if you don't wish to use a skin already available online.

### 1. Setting the disguise

For the disguise, you will want to do something like this:

```yaml
disguise: custom:your_unique_skin_name
```

### 2. Generating the disguise data

This is the tricky part. You start by creating the following config entry:

```yaml
customDisguiseData: player your_unique_skin_name setskin 
```

*It is crucial that the name you set in disguise for the your_unique_skin_name matches the one in customDisguiseData!*

Then you will need to deserialize a player skin. The easiest way to do this for a skin publicly available online is by using the grabskin command from LibsDisguises.

Let's say you want to get [this skin](https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/18512841/buff-villager/).

To do this, you need to run the command `/grabskin https://www.minecraftskins.com/uploads/skins/2021/07/28/buff-villager-18512841.png?v437`

**Note: you need to provide a direct link to the skin file, and not to the page containing the skin. Note where the link points to. In [skindex](https://www.minecraftskins.com/), you can get the direct link by pressing the "Image Link" button which is present at the bottom right of every skin.**

Once you have done this successfully, LibsDisguises will provide you with about 3-6 numbers that say "Click to copy". If you click on these, a long list of numbers and letters will appear. You want to make sure you start at 1 and do all of the numbers in order. To copy them, press ctrl-a and then ctrl-c, then paste them in the file with ctrl-v. Once done, it should look similar to this:

```yaml
customDisguiseData: player your_unique_skin_name setskin {"id":"d1fbb77f-b184-4718-b0a2-c7ae866798d3","name":"Unknown","properties":[{"name":"textures","value":"ewogICJ0aW1lc3RhbXAiIDogMTYyNzU0ODkwMjQ0OSwKICAicHJvZmlsZUlkIiA6ICIxOTI1MjFiNGVmZGI0MjVjODkzMWYwMmE4NDk2ZTExYiIsCiAgInByb2ZpbGVOYW1lIiA6ICJTZXJpYWxpemFibGUiLAogICJzaWduYXR1cmVSZXF1aXJlZCIgOiB0cnVlLAogICJ0ZXh0dXJlcyIgOiB7CiAgICAiU0tJTiIgOiB7CiAgICAgICJ1cmwiIDogImh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvMzlmYTZkMWFlODA2YTY2OGI0OTgzYmZhY2ZkMGUzMzQ5MGE5MGU4YTZmMWE2MmEwZGQ5YzQ1YjdkYjBiNjU1MyIKICAgIH0KICB9Cn0=","signature":"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"}],"legacy":false}
```

And that's it! `customDisguiseData` will work with any deserialized skin code, so if you find other ways of generating the same code in LibsDisguises you can use it here.

The advantage of customDisguiseData is that it is self-contained, meaning you don't have to rely on online players, players with specific skins or anything else. EliteMobs uses it to skin all of the disguised bosses in dungeon packages!

# How can I disguise a custom boss as another type of entity?

To disguise a custom boss (or a regional boss) as another type of entity, all you need to do is add the following line to the boss config file:

```yml
disguise: ENTITY_TYPE
```

As an example, if you want your custom boss to be disguised as a sheep, you'd do:

```yml
disguise: SHEEP
```
## How can I disguise a custom boss as a baby entity?

To disguise a custom boss (or a regional boss) as a baby entity, all you need to do is add the following line to the boss config file:

```yml
disguise: HOGLIN:baby
```
As you can see in this example our boss would be disguised as a Baby Hoglin.

# How can I disguise an entity with a custom disguise?

To disguise a custom boss (or a regional boss) as a custom LibsDisguises entity, you need to create the LibsDisguises disguise first.

Once that's done, the correct syntax is:

```yml
disguise: custom:you_custom_disguise_name
```

# Custom Loot Table

Universal loot format. Used by EliteMobs in several different locations.

Please note that this is the latest format and the one that is recommended to use, but some alternative older formats exist. 

Make sure to start your loot tables with `uniqueLootList:` before adding any settings otherwise the .yml config will error.

### Dropping elite items:

| Key | Details | Values                | Default |
| --- | :-: |-----------------------| --- |
| `filename` | Sets the file name of the Custom Item to use. | [Filename](#filename) | none |

<details> 

<summary align="center"><b>Example</b></summary>

<div align="left">

```yml
uniqueLootList:
  - filename: magmaguys_toothpick.yml
```

This will make the mob drop 1 of *MagmaGuy's Toothpick* with a 100% drop chance.

</div>

</details>

### General settings:

| Key | Details | Values              | Default |

<div align="left">

```yml
uniqueLootList:
  - filename: magmaguys_toothpick.yml
    chance: 0.5
    amount: 10
    ignorePlayerLevel: true
```

This will make the mob drop 10 of *MagmaGuy's Toothpick* with a 50% drop chance while ignoring the player level.

</div>

</details>

### Dropping elite coins:

| Key | Details | Values              | Default |

# Modifying existing minidungeons

Based on popular request, this page goes over the basics of modifying existing Minidungeons. This is not a step-by-step guide, but a wider look at how the systems need to be modified. You will have to read the wiki pages on [Custom Bosses]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md) and [Custom Items]($language$/elitemobs/creating_items.md) in order to modify those values.

### Modifying dungeon difficulty

There are three reasons why you may want to modify the difficulty of the dungeons, and they are as follows:

### Modifying the damage/health multipliers of the bosses

This is the easiest modification to do. If you think that the bosses deal too little or too much damage, or that they have too little or too much health, you can modify the values associated to these modifiers in the boss files contained in the `custombosses` folder.

Example of values you would want to modify:
```yml
healthMultiplier: 0.5
damageMultiplier: 0.5
```
More about boss stats [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=healthmultiplier).

Please keep in mind that for a lot of powers the damage multiplier does not modify the damage applied by the power. Refer to the next section on how to modify powers.

### Modifying the powers of bosses

The main difficulty of EliteMobs is dealing with the various powers that bosses may have. Higher level bosses tend to have more and harder powers, and lower level bosses tend to have fewer and easier powers. Certain powers used together on the same boss make fights easier, and other powers put together can make the fight significantly harder.

Example of values you would want to modify:
```yml
powers:
- invulnerability_fire.yml
- invulnerability_arrow.yml
```
More about boss powers [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=powers).

Since there are too many power combinations to list here, you will have to learn how the powers work and playtest your encounters in order to find the sweet spot for what you think is an encounter that is neither too hard nor too easy.

### Modifying the level of the bosses

This is the most frequently asked question, and while it is possible to do it, it takes a few steps in order to make sure that you are adequately scaling your bosses up or down.

Example of values you would want to modify:
```yml
level: 21
```
More about boss levels [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=level).

This takes a combination of both what is said about the damage / health multipliers, as bosses at lower / higher levels might need slightly different health and damage multipliers to make the fight feel right.

However, the most important aspect to consider here is the powers on the boss. Lower level and higher level bosses tend to have fairly different power sets depending on how hard the fight is meant to be. Having the same set of powers for a level 10 boss and a level 200 boss usually results in fights whose difficulty feels drastically different. Again, the only way to really find the sweet spot is to learn how the powers of the plugin work and playtesting them.

And last, **but not least!** You will probably want to tweak the custom loot. Most bosses in EliteMobs have custom loot, and if you are switching the level of the boss around, odds are that you will want to change the nature of the loot it drops.

Example of values you would want to modify:
```yml
uniqueLootList:
  - filename: mob_drop_boots.yml
    chance: 0.05
```
More about loot drops [here]($language$/elitemobs/loot_tables.md).

### Crediting / publishing modified content

Under EliteMobs you are free to post the dungeons you create on the appropriate channels to do so (Discord). However, if your creation is just a modification of an existing dungeon, your submission may be removed, especially if it's only a small tweak or if it contains or is derived from premium content (for obvious reasons).

You are free and welcome to modify any content that you have purchased or otherwise downloaded to adjust it to your server's needs for use within your own network, however for obvious reasons this does not provide you with redistribution rights.

We reserve the right to take down community submissions for any reason and at any time, though we would hate to actually have to do that.

### Further info

If you believe that this page should be further expanded upon, leave a suggestion on Discord saying what should be added to it. More info about the various systems mentioned here are present in the other wiki pages.

Refer to this sheet for Oasis quest flow.

# User commands

*Note: All player permissions are set to be true by default. This means that they are already set up.*

*If you do not want players to have access to a specific feature via permissions, you will have to deny that player the permission!*

| Command |    Description    |
|---------|:-----------------:|
| `/elitemobs` / `/em` | Main command, condenses all player info in the plugin in an easy to access menu. *Note:* all other user commands are in this main command. `/em menu` is also a valid command for this |
| `/adventurersguild` / `/ag`     |In a recommended setup, teleports the player to the adventurer's guild world where they interact with the various EliteMobs NPCs.|
| `/shareitem`     |Links an item in chat so other players may see its stats.|
| `/em help`     |Lists all commands. The remaining user commands are usually replaced by the use of NPCs or the `/em` interface!|
| `/em wallet`     |Displays player money.|
| `/em pay <username> <amount>`     |Lets players pay each other. Transactions are taxed a configurable amount.|
| `/em updateitem`     |Updates the lore of an item in case it desynced. This command is meant for debugging purposes, and is not required in normal play.|
| `/em spawntp`     |Teleports a player to a server spawn.|

## NPC commands

These commands are only useful if you do not have the Adventurer's Guild Hub with NPCs installed. 

It is recommended you install these to run all of these commands through NPCs instead of having players remember how the commands work.

| Command | Description |
|---------|:-----------:|
| `/em rank`     |     Opens the rank menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em shop`     |     Accesses the shop or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild Hub.     |
| `/em customshop`     |     Accesses the custom shop or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em repair`     |     Accesses the repair menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em enchant`     |     Accesses the enchant menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em scrap`     |     Accesses the scrap menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |
| `/em unbind`     |     Accesses the unbind menu or teleports players to the Adventurer's Guild hub.     |

## Internal user commands

**These commands are meant to be run from in-game menus such as quests from the quest menu. If no instructions are written about how to get an ID, then that means it is not possible to get that ID other than by running the command from the in-game menu.** For convenience, these have been split into the identifiable and unidentifiable categories.

### Identifiable

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
|`/em dungeontp <dungeonid>`         |Teleports a player to a dungeon.|
*Note: this is meant to be run from the `/em` menu, as it is impossible for players to guess dungeon IDs. The IDs of the dungeons are the same as the .yml filenames in `~/plugins/EliteMobs/dungeonpackages/`. <br/>You can see the IDs on console when using the `/em` command and pick a teleport from the Teleports page.*

### Unidentifiable

| Command | Description |
|---------|:-----------:|
| `/em quest accept <questID>`     |     Accepts a quest.     |
| `/em quest track <questID>`     |     Tracks a quest.     |
| `/em quest complete <questID>`     |     Completes a quest.     |
| `/em quest leave <questID>`     |     Leaves a quest.     |
| `/em trackcustomboss <uuid>`     |     Tracks a custom boss. Note: this is meant to be run from the `/em` menu, as it is impossible for players to guess boss UUIDs.     |

The following is the full list of PAPI placeholders for EliteMobs.

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|:-----------:|
| `%elitemobs_player_combat_tier%`         |     Displays the combat tier of a player, meaning the tier used for spawning Elite Mobs around the player.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_active_guild_rank_numerical%`         |     Displays the active guild rank for the player in number form. Beware that the active guild rank may be lower than the actual maximum guild rank if the player lowers it on purpose.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_maximum_guild_rank_numerical%`         |     Displays the maximum guild rank for the player in number form. Beware that this may be higher than the guild rank they have active if they lowered it on purpose.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_active_guild_rank_name%`         |     Displays the name of the active guild rank. This is the option you probably want to use if you want to display a player's active guild rank.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_maximum_guild_rank_name%`         |     Displays the name of the maximum guild rank. This is the option you probably want to use if you want to display a player's maximum guild rank.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_prestige_guild_rank_numerical%`         |     Displays a player's prestige level, numerically.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_money%`         |     Displays how much EliteMobs currency a player currently has.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_top_tier%`         |     Displays the highest threat tier out of any online players.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_top_guild_rank%`         |     Displays the name of the online player with the highest guild rank.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_shortened_guild_rank%`         |     Displays the shortened version of the prestige and active guild ranks, specifically for chat or other locations where rank names can't take up too much space (scoreboards). By default, uses a fleur de lis and a star unicode to represent the prestige level and active guild rank respectively, and uses roman numerals for the numbers. This is 100% configurable in the AdventurersGuild.yml configuration file.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_top_guild_rank%`         |     Displays the name of the online player with the highest guild rank.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_shortened_guild_rank%`         |     Displays the shortened version of the prestige and active guild ranks, specifically for chat or other locations where rank names can't take up too much space (scoreboards). By default, uses a fleur de lis and a star unicode to represent the prestige level and active guild rank respectively, and uses roman numerals for the numbers. This is 100% configurable in the AdventurersGuild.yml configuration file.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_kills%`         |     Displays the amount of Elite kills a player has.     |
| `%elitemobs_player_deaths%`         |     Displays the amount of times a player has died to an elite.     |

# How to use

1) ***EliteMobs does not require using the PAPI eCloud.*** It just works as long as EliteMobs is on your server. You can skip this step.
2) If you want to use placeholders you will need to have ***PAPI*** installed on your server, as well as a ***plugin to use those placeholders***. That means that if you want to use it with chat, you will need a chat plugin. Same thing if you want to make titles, scoreboards, tab lists or anything else.

-----

## Here is a short list of plugins that use PAPI:
### Chat:
- [Venturechat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/venturechat.771/)
- [ChatControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrol%E2%84%A2-the-ultimate-chat-plugin-500-000-downloads-1-2-5-1-16-4.271/)
### Other:
- [FeatherBoard](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/featherboard.2691/)

***The list above is just a few of the most popular examples. There are other. Please don't ask for more recommendations or for support for those plugins. I did not make them and I will not do support for them.***

-----

3) Add the placeholder (the list is above) in the plugin you chose.

***Note: most plugins use the format `{elitemobs_XXXXXXX_YYYYYY}` instead of `%elitemobs_XXXXXXX_YYYYYY%`*** 

If it's not working for you, try changing your use of `%%` to `{}`. If it's still not working after that, try the command `/papi parse YOUR_USERNAME_HERE %elitemobs_YOUR_PLACEHOLDER_HERE%` from in-game (replace what's capitalized). 

If that gives you a valid output, then you configured something wrong, and you need to seek support with whichever plugin you're using the placeholders on.

# Introduction

On this page, you'll discover various examples of custom boss powers created with EliteScript and the [WebApp](https://magmaguy.com/webapp/webapp.html). These straightforward examples illustrate how to utilize multiple actions and other features to craft unique boss powers. 

Additionally, visual demonstrations accompany each example, so it is easier to understand how the script operates within the game.

Feel free to copy any of the examples and use them in your own dungeons or worlds.

## Power Examples

### Slam Down

This script will cause the boss to teleport 8 blocks above the player who dealt damage to it, then slam into the ground. Afterward, it will apply the slow potion effect to any players within 3 blocks of the boss, and display the message 'Stunned' on screen for 3 seconds.

### Push Away

This script will generate a 4-block dome around the boss. Subsequently, it will initiate a particle effect at the zone border, lasting for one second, then another action will push away any players within the zone. Due to the offset setting for the push, players will be slightly propelled upwards. Finally, the script will send a message to any players within the zone.

### Arrow Rain

Makes a script that will draw a circle on the ground around the player that damaged the mob, it also shows a message on the screen telling the player to move out of the circle. Then 2 seconds later it will fire arrows downwards at that same location just from 10 blocks up.

### Fire Aura

This will create a script that will spawn particles around the boss using the cylinder zone, it will last 6 seconds. The boss will also be given the tag `FireOn` for 6 seconds. 

Should the players attack the boss while the tag is active then the players will get set on fire for 1 second. This is done using conditions, the `SetOnFire` script will only be able to execute if the boss has the matching tag `FireOn`.

### Poison Lines

This script will create two cuboid zones centered on the boss. The boss AI is set to be off for 2 seconds. The cuboid zones are configured in such a way that they will form a plus symbol on the ground.

The script will then make cloud particles for 2 seconds in the zones and then it will make smoke particles and apply poison potion effect to the zones for 3 seconds.

### Bounce

This script creates a 10 block cylinder zone centered on the boss and then it applies particle effects and push to the zone for 10 seconds.

The push action pushes the players slightly upwards every tick, creating the illusion that the players are bouncing around while they are in the zone.

### Summon

This script will create a cylindrical zone (positioned 6 blocks above the player due to the applied offset) centered around the player who damaged the boss. Additionally, it will display a message on screen to that player.

After a delay of 2 seconds, reinforcements will spawn into the designated zone. However, only a portion of the zone will be occupied by reinforcements since we used `coverage`. If the player fails to eliminate all the reinforcements, they will automatically despawn after 20 seconds (400 ticks).

### Potion Zones

This script is activated when a player damages the boss. It then executes either the `PotionZoneBad` or `PotionZoneGood` script.

In the `PotionZoneBad` script, a cylindrical zone is generated around nearby players that are within 20 blocks from the boss. It produces cloud and large smoke particle effects with a specified coverage, inflicts the wither potion effect, and delivers a message to nearby players.

In the `PotionZoneGood` script, a cylindrical zone is generated around players that are within 20 blocks from the boss. The particle effects for this script are inverted. This script applies a healing potion effect instead of wither and sends a message to nearby players.

### Blind Waves

This script initiates two ground ray waves projected in both positive and negative X directions originating from the boss.

We utilize the `offset` parameter to determine the length and size of the rays, specifically by defining the Z value. Additionally, we specify the direction of wave propagation by setting the X values. (This is just an explanation on how this specific script uses these values, you don't have to make yours exactly like this)

While it's possible to adjust the Y values to increase the height of the ray waves, we leave it at 0 to allow players the option to jump over the rays.

The parameter `animationDuration` dictates the time taken for the ray waves to travel from targets to final targets. Reducing this value would make the rays faster and more challenging to evade.

Subsequently, particle and potion effects are applied. Players failing to avoid or jump over the ray waves will be blinded for 5 seconds (100 ticks).

### Freeze Wall

This script creates 3 rotating rays centered on the boss. We need 3 different rotating rays since we cannot define ray height so we use several scripts and `offset` to make the rays stack in height so they appear like one singular rotating *wall*.

All 3 scripts have identical zones except the `offset` being different. They are set to be 6 blocks in length starting from the boss and are set to do a 360 degree yaw rotation in 10 seconds (200 ticks).

All scripts have particles effects set and will apply the `VISUAL_FREEZE` action for 5 seconds (100 ticks) to any players that are *hit* by the ray walls.

# Premade Powers List

A boss can have one or several powers. We recommend you keep the amount under 5. A full list of powers can be found in the `~/plugins/EliteMobs/powers` folder.

The following list is not necessarily complete [since you can make custom powers]($language$elitemobs/creating_powers.md) and some dungeons come with their own powers.

*Note: Click [here]($language$/elitemobs/creating_bosses.md&section=powers) to learn how you can customize bosses with these powers.*

The power GIFs are solely for demonstration purposes. Please note that their animation does **NOT** reflect the actual animation speed of the powers in-game.

# Elite Script Format

Note that some of the powers are in the [Elite Script]($language$/elitemobs/creating_powers.md) format, and can be customized.

Here is an example of the *attack_blinding.yml* power and how it is formatted using the [Elite Script]($language$/elitemobs/creating_powers.md) format:

<div align="left">

```yml
isEnabled: true
effect: SPELL_MOB
powerType: MISCELLANEOUS
eliteScript:
  BlindPlayer:
    Events:
      - PlayerDamagedByEliteMobEvent
    Actions:
      - potionEffectType: blindness
        amplifier: 0
        action: POTION_EFFECT
        duration: 60
        Target:
          targetType: DIRECT_TARGET
```

This feature enables you to fully customize the *attack_blinding.yml* power. You can specify which potion effect should be applied, the duration of the effect, the target, and the event that triggers the boss to use the power.

</div>

# What is the Prestige System?

The Prestige System rewards players for resetting their EliteMobs rank, items and currency (in short, all of their progression) for two benefits: **big fixed bonuses** and **showing off**.

It is possible, and encouraged, to put the ranks of players as prefixes on chat through the use of Placeholder API in combination with any chat plugin which is compatible with Placeholder API.

One of the purposes of this is to allow players to clearly distinguish themselves as having not only beaten all of the EliteMobs progression, but have potentially done so several times, establishing their status as a very cool elite gamer.

## How can players unlock the Prestige System?

Once players have reached maximum guild rank, they will be given the option to reset their progress and Prestige. This is done through the guild rank menu or by talking to the Guild Attendant NPC in the Adventurer's Guild.

<div align="center">

![prestige_guild_rank.jpg](../../../img/wiki/prestige_guild_rank.jpg)

</div>

## What is the cost of the Prestige System?

**Everything.** At least, everything related to EliteMobs. The player's current guild rank will be reset to 1, the currency will be wiped and **all the items will lose their binding to the player**, meaning that when the player tries to equip it, it will drop and they will be unable to pick it back up.

This is quite funny to see happen all at once when a fully equipped player activates the prestige while having all gear equipped, making it look like they're being born anew.

## What are the big fixed bonuses of the Prestige System?

Activating the prestige system will unlock the following in differing amounts, based on prestige level and guild rank level:

- Maximum health (starting from prestige 1)
- Chance to crit (starting from prestige 2)
- Chance to dodge (starting from prestige 3)

Additionally, players will gain more money per kill for each prestige tier they increase, but rank costs will also go up proportionately. <br>This is to reward players for upgrading, but also to lower the incentive that a player might have to try to farm at a really high level and then find a way to use that money to speed through the ranks of the next prestige run.

A fully upgraded player can experience 100 max health (compared to the vanilla 20), 10% base chance to dodge, 10% base chance to crit and 15x currency drop multiplier. This assumes a default setup. ***It's also important to note that this is for the maximum rank of Prestige 10 rank 20, which takes dedicated players years to obtain.*** Most people will stop playing Minecraft before grinding enough to reach this level.

## Prestige System Bonus Overview
Below is a list of bonuses and when they unlock as set by **default** in the Adventurer's Guild configuration:

<div align="center">

| Prestige |   Bonus    | Value |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| Prestige 1  |  Health 1  |   2   |
| Prestige 2  | Critical 1 |   3   | Actually 3
| Prestige 3  |  Dodge 1   |   3   | Actually 4
| Prestige 4  |  Health 2  |  2.5  |
| Prestige 5  | Critical 2 |   6   |
| Prestige 6  |  Dodge 2   |   6   |
| Prestige 7  |  Health 3  |   3   |
| Prestige 8  | Critical 3 |  10   |
| Prestige 9  |  Dodge 3   |  10   |
| Prestige 10 |  Health 4  |   4   |

</div>

These values overwrite each other, indicating that, for instance, at Prestige 1, players would receive a bonus of 2 health for every rank. However, upon reaching Prestige 4, this bonus increases to 2.5 per rank.
<br>The dodge and critical bonus values set what the bonus will be at max rank for that Prestige level. Meaning that if a player maxes out all ranks at Prestige level 6 they would have a dodge and critical bonus of 6%.

*This guide assumes you are using EliteMobs ***7.2.37*** or later.*

# First boot

Restart the server once.

<details>

<summary><b>Why?</b></summary>

EliteMobs increases the maximum health of your spigot.yml config file the first time the server starts up. This is so Elite mobs can have more than 2000 health. It does not alter the health of any other mob - so it doesn't change vanilla or plugin mobs.

This change requires a server restart to actually work.

</details>

# Permissions

As of EliteMobs 7.2.23, all recommended permissions are already setup by default. You can see more about permissions [here]($language$/elitemobs/permissions_and_commands.md).

# Dungeons & Adventurer's Guild Hub World

As of EliteMobs 7.2.35, there is now an `imports` folder in the EliteMobs directory. The installation process for the Dungeons, Adventurer's Guild World is the same:

1) Download the files. You can click on the red glass in `/em setup` to get links to the downloads.

2) Upload / move the files to your server's `/plugins/EliteMobs/imports` folder. Make sure you put the **ZIPPED** files inside the `imports` folder without modifying them in any way, EliteMobs will automatically extract the files and move them to the correct locations.

<div align="center">

</details>

</div>

3) Restart or do `/em reload`. After a few seconds the dungeons should auto-install, when you do `/em setup` the indicators for the dungeons you downloaded should be green and indicating that the dungeons are properly installed and up-to-date. If any dungeons show a yellow glass pane then that means there is a newer version of the dungeon and it needs to be updated.

To update dungeon content, simply repeat the installation steps above. **You do ***not*** have to delete any files**, EliteMobs handles that when you import the update.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## The minidungeon is just flat terrain

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

95% of the time this means you did not follow the setup instructions. If you unzipped any files or loaded any worlds using other plugins, reinstall the content following the steps listed above. You do not need any other plugins to load the worlds correctly.

</details>

## NPC chat looks weird / wormholes aren't working / other weird behavior after installing

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

Run the command `/em reload` after setting a dungeon up to make sure all of the values get fully initialized. A restart is even better, but should not be necessary.

</details>

## Bosses aren't spawning

### The boss was spawning earlier!

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

Regional bosses have a respawn time. You can check when the boss is scheduled to respawn by going to its configuration file and copying the numbers after the `:` in the spawn locations section.

Example:

```yml
spawnLocations:
- em_primis,1100.5,22.5,526.5,0.0,0.0:1643259941451
```

In this case the numbers you're looking for are `1643259941451`. You can use [this](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php) website to convert that to a specific date. You can delete the numbers to force the boss to respawn, make sure you do `/em reload` after deleting them.

</details>

### The boss never spawned!

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

Check the following things:

- Did you or someone else kill the boss, or did it escape via the timeout feature? The boss may be respawning. Check the cooldowns, info about that is in the section above.
- See if there are any errors on console, especially after you install the dungeon or after an `/em reload`. The errors should tell you what's wrong.
- Check if your region is protected by some other plugin that would prevent mob spawning
- Check the difficulty of your world, mobs can't spawn in peaceful difficulty
- Check WorldGuard flags, see if mob spawning is set to allow
- Check if you installed the dungeon content over the spawn area, that is protected by default
- Very, very rarely, the issue might have to do with the day your server thinks it is. Make sure your server machine's date is correct, otherwise the respawn mechanic might cause some issues.

</details>


## Something's messed up and I just can't fix it

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

This usually happens after trying and failing to correctly modify files in a way that EliteMobs could not self-repair. If you are stuck and can't figure out how to repair it from the console messages on startup / dungeon installation, the best thing to do is a clean installation of EliteMobs.

Back up your `~/plugins/EliteMobs/data` folder to keep player data, then delete the `~/plugins/EliteMobs/` folder. Start your server up, shut it down, restore the contents of your backed up data folder **while the server is offline** and then start it up again. You can now resume installing EliteMobs content.

</details>


The Soulbind enchantment links all EliteMobs loot to the players the loot drops for. This means that each player gets their own reward from killing an Elite Mob, making sharing loot a non-issue.

Players are unable to pick up loot that isn't soulbound to them from the floor. They are able to pick it up from chests, but are unable to equip them in combat, meaning that they can only really be carried around. 

This is so players don't accidentally clog up each other's chests with unmovable items. Additionally, players can only sell items soulbound to them.

This enchantment is meant to be used in conjunction with the guild tier loot limiter.


***

Like all enchantments, it can be disabled in the enchantments folder (soulbind.yml, set `isEnabled` to `false`), though this is strongly not recommended.

***Issues caused by removing Soulbind:***
- Elites will no longer drop coins
- Players can give diamond or netherite gear out for free to everyone with a minimal amount of grinding
- The economy will instantly break, allowing veteran players to powerboost players instantly though dozens of ranks
- The loot limiter will no longer work, meaning that players will be able to just wear the armor and weapons of the highest tier players

***

Admins can remove Soulbind from items using `/em unbind`.

Players can remove soulbind from an item by using an Unbind Scroll. By default this is dropped by the Binder of Worlds, but you can configure other bosses to drop it if you want.

Note: This section talks about normal Elite Mob spawning, not Custom Bosses. It also assume you're using the default configuration settings.

# When does an Elite Mob spawn?

When a normal mob spawns near a player wearing armor. Only armor of at least level 1 will cause Elite Mobs to show up. Higher level armors spawn higher level mobs.
<br>They spawn based on a percentage chance, which is configurable in the MobCombatSettings.yml file.

**If the player gear is not good enough, no Elite Mobs will spawn. If you are just roaming the wilds with no equipment on, you will not find any Elite Mobs.**

## What determines the level of the Elite Mob?

* The level of the mob is the same as the average level of the equipment the player is wearing.

## What determines the level of an item?

* Non-elite items have levels equal to the level of the material (listed below). Elite Items have levels that are *usually* based on the level of the elite killed.

### Material levels
* Trident material: Level 9
* Netherite material: Level 8
* Diamond material: Level 7
* Iron material: Level 6
* Stone / Chain material: Level 5
* Gold / Wood / Leather material: Level 3

***

# What kind of rewards can I get from Elite Mobs?
Before talking about the special rewards, it's important to note that **only naturally spawned Elite Mobs will drop special loot**. You can not use mob spawners to get special loot. Additionally, the anti cheat mechanisms may remove an Elite Mob's eligibility to drop special loot. 

This means that if the system detects that you are fighting an Elite Mob which is trapped or which can't reach you for some reason (you're flying / on a tower / it's in a hole) it will cease to show its power trail and will no longer drop any special loot.


Elite Mobs can drop three types of special items: procedurally generated items, custom items and unique items. Additionally, they drop more vanilla loot than regular mobs. The drop chance is not 100%, but the odds of getting loot increase with the mob level.

## What's a procedurally generated item?
Procedurally generated items are items that are generated semi-randomly based on the server's configuration settings. There is a nearly endless amount of possibilities for procedurally generated items. 

Usually procedurally generated items are armor, weapons and tools of any material quality with varying enchantment quantities and levels.

## What's a custom item?
Custom items are items either preloaded in the plugin (such as MagmaGuy's toothpick and charms) or added by admins. These items are fully customized, and can give players potion effects when either worn or held in the main hand or offhand.

## What's a unique item?
Unique items are special drops from Custom Bosses which are similar to custom items. They may sometimes also have unique powers, such as the flamethrower power for the Zombie King's axe.

***

# How can I get better loot?
The higher the level of Elite Mob killed, the better the item dropped!

Here you will find described as briefly as I can the intended gameplay loop for EliteMobs. This guide is aimed at new admins who want to get a grasp of what EliteMobs can do.

# Step 1: Player's first encounter
A player in your server will acquire armor during normal gameplay. Once they have anything at iron level or better, they will start facing Elite Mobs which spawn naturally around them based on the armor the players are wearing. 

Players can also opt out of participating by lowering their [Guild Rank]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md).
<br>These Elite Mobs (when their level is high enough and the antiexploit system isn't triggered) can drop three types of loot:

* Procedurally generated loot (the most common kind)
* Custom loot (somewhat rare)
* Elite Coins

(Note: You can read more about Elite Mob spawning and rewards [here]($language$/elitemobs/spawning_tiers_loot.md))

Upon looting, the player will be informed by the plugin that the coins can be used and the items sold at the store in the [Adventurer's Guild]($language$/elitemobs/adventurers_guild_world.md).

# Step 2: Discovering the economy
Once the player has gotten the information about selling items, they'll naturally be drawn to sell them. If the world is set up, they will then find the Adventurer's Guild NPCs (details for world download and setup and in the spigot resource post).

They will find out that EliteMobs uses its own currency, which is necessary for balance reasons. They will also find out that they can unlock guild ranks, and will later discover that this is required if they wish to progress beyond level 10 elite mobs, as they won't get loot beyond tier 10 without unlocking more ranks. 

They will also be able to find out about the quest system, and start fulfilling quests to get extra currency, which will naturally lead them to seek opponents they would otherwise avoid. They may also find the Combat Instructor NPC, which will give them tips about the combat system. Globally, all NPCs give players important advice as the players interact with them.

# Step 3: Progression
Now that the players have an idea of what's ahead of them, they will fight against increasingly stronger Elite Mobs as they progress through item tiers. 

By the time they reach diamond tier, they will find themselves capped by their guild rank, which should encourage them to unlock further tiers. 
<br>Additionally, they will encounter random events which should increase their interest in the various mechanics that the plugin has to offer, especially when it comes to [custom enchantments]($language$/elitemobs/custom_enchantments_list.md) such as the flamethrower.

# Step 4: High Tiers
Once the player has progressed up to around item tier 80 (or guild rank 8), they will start maxing out the difficulty of EliteMobs (for now). High level combat requires quite a lot more strategy, planning and combat execution than lower levels, as mobs have up to 7 different powers by that stage. 

They will be able to tell which loot they want to keep and which they want to discard, and will have a good idea of which are their favorite custom items. I highly recommend you make a lot of custom items as these are currently the main focus of mid to top tier players of EliteMobs.

# (Mini)Dungeoneering
Assuming you installed the recommended [Minidungeons & Lairs]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md) at some point - possibly even rather early on - players will probably be drawn to challenge Lairs, Minidungeons and Adventures. 

These are locations where Custom Bosses spawn and, after being killed, respawn on a delay, creating a centralized location where players can challenge tough bosses in a fair way.

Here are the main selling points of the minidungeons:

* Since the terrain is premade and protected, and so are the bosses, combat can't be exploited.
* Since it centralizes combat, you can have lower spawn rates for natural mobs and end up with a lower overall performance impact.
* Since the loot is premade, it is usually quite special, and players learn to go to certain places to farm for specific gear that they might like.
* Since the bosses are premade, the battles are manually balanced and it results in far more interesting & challenging but fair fights.
* In the case of adventures, these are full-on massive adventure maps with vast questlines, sidequests and sometimes even arenas and dungeons inside of dungeons!
* It looks great and players love spending days in them.

[More about minidungeons!]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md)

# Instanced Dungeoneering
Some dungeons are instanced challenges. This means that a world is created when a group joins the dungeon, and once the group starts the dungeon players will be unable to join other than to spectate it. 
<br>There is a dedicated system for respawning which gives players 3 deaths each before being struck out.

Dungeons are the most balanced and developed content in EliteMobs, as they are significantly harder to exploit than any other content.

Dungeons have difficulties players can pick from, and the highest difficulties are the hardest challenges in EliteMobs but also the most rewarding!

[More about dungeons!]($language$/elitemobs/dungeons.md)

# Arenas
EliteMobs also has arenas which players can challenge. These are wave-based challenges which players must overcome for a preset amount of waves. They reward players for reaching specific arena waves. 

This content is also instanced, and the join and respawn limitations from the Dungeoneering section also applies here.

Arenas can be quite hard to beat, so they make for a fun and rewarding challenge!

As of 7.1.0, by popular demand, you are now able to turn on Vault to unify the EliteMobs economy with your server's economy.

***Now here's why that's a bad idea:***

EliteMobs has no leveling system. The [progression system]($language$/elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md) is tied to getting better items through killing Elite Mobs and buying higher guild ranks to access higher level loot, higher level mobs, higher level quests and, higher level arena challenges and dungeons.

Additionally, EliteMobs has a very delicate balance when it comes to purchasing charms and reselling loot obtained from Elite Mobs.

***Therefore, if you combine your server's economy with the EliteMobs economy, players will be able to easily buy their way to the top, potentially bypassing the learning curve.***

Now the [progression system]($language$/elitemobs/understanding_the_basics_of_elitemobs.md) won't work properly, which leads to even worse problems. High level Elite Mobs have various powers, and players are meant to slowly learn those powers through fighting against them for dozens of hours, learning how to identify the powers that the Elite Mobs have and how to counter those powers, as well as learning how to prepare to go into combat against Elite Mobs.

If players skip straight to the endgame, they will feel like the combat difficulty is nearly impossible and extremely unfair, as they will not have had the time to develop the knowledge required to kill the EliteMobs efficiently through long hours of play.

You can enable Vault compatibility in the `EconomySettings.yml` configuration file.

Listed here are the WorldGuard flags EliteMobs has and their function.


***

# elitemob-spawning (allow/deny)
Sets whether Elite Mobs can spawn in the region. The default behavior is that Elite Mobs are allowed to spawn everywhere, and therefore the primary use of this flag is to disable them for a specific region. If you want to disable Elite Mob spawning for an entire world, I recommend editing the ValidWorlds.yml file instead.


***

# elitemob-only-spawning (allow/deny)
Sets whether only Elite Mobs can spawn in a region. This does not increase the amount of Elite Mobs that spawn in an area, it only prevents non-elite mob entities from spawning in that area. This is for users who wish to have entire areas where only Elite Mobs can spawn, such as arenas or higher difficulty zones.


***

# elitemobs-antiexploit (allow/deny)
Sets whether the antiexploit can trigger in a region. Allow will let the Antiexploit run, deny will prevent it from running. Deny is recommended for premade arenas and dungeons where you've already tested the terrain for exploits.

***

Also please note: NPCs override the mob-spawning deny flag as a form of third party compatibility with WorldGuard. If you do not wish to have NPCs in an area, I recommend removing them manually.

***

# elitemobs-maximum-level

Sets the maximum level of elite mobs that can spawn in a region. Only affects naturally spawned elites (Custom Bosses ignore this). The level must be an integer value (no values like `1.5`, you have to use whole numbers like `1` or `2`).

***

# elitemobs-minimum-level

Sets the minimum level of elite mobs that can spawn in a region. Only affects naturally spawned elites (Custom Bosses ignore this). The level must be an integer value (no values like `1.5`, you have to use whole numbers like `1` or `2`).

***

# elitemobs-dungeon

Sets the area to only allow normal mobs spawned with the CUSTOM spawn reason, as well as Regional Bosses and Custom Bosses. This is for use in minidungeons.


The following is the full wiki of the eternaltd plugin!


# How to Create a Custom EternalTD Map

## Creating the level.yml file for your map

Get your map started by creating a level config file following these simple steps:

1. Start by making a new text document and giving it a name like *your_level_name.yml* (replace "your_level_name" with your actual level/map name).

2. Open the file in your favorite text editor.

3. Let's begin with the fun part! Add your level's name using this setting:
```yaml
levelName: "&aMy Awesome Level"
```
Feel free to spice it up with some Minecraft colors or other text modifiers.

4. Now, give your level some character with a cool description:
```yaml
levelDescription:
- "&aMy level is pretty cool."
- "&aHope you enjoy!"
```
You can add more lines to the description, but keeping it brief is a good idea.

5. Time for waves! Specify which EternalTD waves your level should use:
```yaml
wavesConfigFile: my_waves.yml
```
Just remember to use the actual name of your wave file. One wave per level!

6. Set the world (build) your level will use:
```yaml
worldName: my_world_folder_name
```
Use the actual world name found within EternalTD's *worlds* folder.

7. Last but not least, pick the perfect environment for your level's setting:
```yaml
environment: NORMAL
```
You can choose between NORMAL, NETHER, or THE_END. Take your pick.

Your level config file is all set! The rest of the file will be filled out by EternalTD commands that we will be using in the next steps when we map out the build.

## Preparing your build
Before mapping out your build for use with EternalTD, it's essential to set it up in the following way:

- Set it in a Void world. If using multiverse, you can use the command:
  ```
  /mvcreate yourworldnamehere NORMAL -g VoidGen:.
  ```
- Have a tight world border around the build.
- Create a barrier cylinder a few blocks below the build with a height of one block and a radius large enough to reach the world border (recommended 200 block radius). Using WorldEdit, you can execute:
  ```
  //cyl barrier 200 1
  ```
- Set the spawn point to be in the center of the build in a safe place.
- Apply the following rules:
    - /gamerule doWeatherCycle false
    - /gamerule doDaylightCycle false
    - /gamerule doMobSpawning false
    - /gamerule doFireTick false
    - /gamerule fireDamage false
    - /gamerule mobGriefing false
    - /gamerule disableRaids true
    - /gamerule announceAdvancements false
- The play area of the map needs to be on the same Y level. Anything that is higher or lower will be ignored when we start the mapping process.

## Mapping out the build for use with EternalTD
To map out the play area of your build for use with EternalTD, follow these steps:

1. Manually measure the build, making sure to include only the play area and nothing else. Note down the coordinates as you measure.
<br>The play area should include the start (monster spawn) and end sections of the map. The start is usually built using green blocks and with red blocks for the end.


2. Start by measuring the X, Y, and Z axes of the build. Stand at one corner of your maps play area on the X-axis and write down the reported coordinate (you can use the block coordinates for this). Move to the opposite side of the X-axis and write down that coordinate.


3. For the Y-axis, stand on the **play area** and write down the reported coordinate.


4. Repeat the same process as done for the X-axis to measure the Z-axis. You can take a look at this example image to help you understand what we are trying to accomplish here:
   ![Mapping Example](https://i.imgur.com/IZfh2Nt.jpeg)
   Notice how we are only measuring the coordinates where we want our play area to be and ignoring the rest. As in the example please make sure you include start and end when measuring out the play area. <br>If the play area you are measuring is wider at one end and narrower at the other you should measure the widest section.


5. After completing the measurements, you should have something like this:
   ```
   X axis: -57, 56
   Y axis: 65
   Z axis: 34, -34
   ```

6. Rearrange these numbers from highest to lowest to get two full sets of XYZ coordinates:
   ```
   56 65 34 (highest XYZ values)
   -57 65 -34 (lowest XYZ values)
   ```

7. Use the following command to select the coordinates:
   ```
   /etd selectfloorcoordinate Xhigh Y Zhigh Xlow Y Zlow
   Example: /etd selectfloorcoordinate 56 65 34 -57 65 -34
   ```

8. The coordinates have now been selected and are in memory. If you get an error then your measurement was incorrect or the play area was not properly built. To check if we mapped the play area correctly, run the following command:
   ```
   /etd register your_level_name.yml test
   ```
   Replace "your_level_name" with the actual level/map name you are trying to create. If everything was done correctly, you should see barriers marking every single tile in your play area.


9. Go over the play area and ensure everything looks like it should and then run the command again but this time without the *test* at the end.
   ````
   /etd register your_level_name.yml
   ````
   This will now save the play area to your level file and your level file should now be ready for use.

## Trimming the world folder
There are several files and folders located in your world folder that we can discard since EternalTD does not use all of them. This will cut down the size of your world and make it easier to distribute.

For NORMAL Environment:

To prepare your world, **keep** the following files and folders:

1.  **region** folder


2.  **raids.dat** from within the **data** folder (ensure it's inside the **data** folder when copying)


3.  **level.dat** file

You can safely delete all other files and folders located in the world folder. This will set up your world correctly for the NORMAL environment.

For NETHER and THE_END Environment:

To prepare your world, keep the following files and folders:

1.  **region** folder inside the **DIM-1** folder (ensure it's inside the **DIM-1** folder when copying)


2.  **raids.dat** from within the **data** folder (ensure it's inside the **data** folder when copying)


3.  **level.dat** file

You can safely delete all other files and folders located in the world folder. This will set up your world correctly for the NETHER and THE_END environments.


The following is the full wiki of the freeminecraftmodels plugin!

# ***Before you start!***

FreeMinecraftModels (FMM) is currently in **alpha**! This means that several features are not yet done, and are actively
being worked on.

However, at this moment, the core of the plugin is fully functional - converting bbmodel files, generating resource
packs, spawning entities in-game and managing their animations is all working, if perhaps not 100% polished.

Consider supporting the development at https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy !

The exported resource pack contents are licensed under the CC0 license, no rights reserved. You are free to use,
distribute, modify for any purposes without restrictions or the need for attribution.

# Using this plugin

## What can FreeMinecraftModels (FMM) do for Minecraft server admins?

It can:

- Import .bbmodel or fmmodel (FFM's custom format) models
- Generate resource packs with models that exceed normal Minecraft resource pack model limits (up to ~~112x112x112~~
  106x106x106 units or 7x7x7 in-game blocks)
- Display these models in-game through the use of the command `/fmm spawn static <id>` where the id is the file name of
  the model, in lowercase and without the file extension
- Animate these models as they were configured to be animated in Blockbench
- Handle default state animations without requiring other plugins (walk, idle, death, attack, spawn)

### How do you add an existing model?

To import a model, just drag the .bbmodel to the imports folder and do `/fmm reload`. This will generate a .fmmodel file in the `models` folder and add the model to the resource pack in the `outputs` folder.

***You will need to use that resource pack to view the model correctly!*** It is a normal resource pack, so all you need to do is put it in your resource pack folder. Minecraft servers have a way to host resource packs on third party services such as google drive or a specialized service such as https://resourcepack.host/, that last website might be the easiest way of doing it.

### How do you view the model in-game?

There are two (planned) categories of models.

- `Static` models are for models that do not move (but can have animations), and serve more like decorations - think
  something like a light post or a Christmas tree.
- `Dynamic` models are for models that behave like Minecraft mobs, that is to say they move around and do various
  behaviors associated to mobs. Think something like custom boss models or adding completely new entity types to
  Minecraft.

#### Viewing static models in-game

To view static models in-game, use the command `/fmm spawn static <id>` where the id is the file name of the model, in lowercase and without the file extension.

#### Viewing dynamic models in-game

To view dynamic models in-game, use the command `/fmm spawn dynamic <id>` where the id is the file name of the model, in
lowercase and without the file extension.

## What can FreeMinecraftModels (FMM) do for modelers?

FMM follows the standard resource pack rules for resource pack generation. Furthermore, it tries to be as compatible
with models compatible with ModelEngine as possible in order to try to standardize model creation across plugins.

### Model generation features / restrictions

If you have ever created models for ModelEngine, you will be familiar with a lot of the Minecraft resource pack
generation restrictions:

#### **Cubes:**

Cubes are the same here as they are in Blockbench, they are the cubes that make up the model.

- Cubes can go up to ~~112x112x112~~ 106x106x106 "pixels" (Blockbench units) or 7x7x7 in-game blocks (normal Minecraft
  restrictions bypassed using display sizes, soon to be further bypassed for 1.19.4+ thanks to display entities)
- Legal rotations for cubes are 0, 22.5, -22.5, 45 and -45. No other rotation works.
- Cubes only rotate in one axis, meaning that a rotation of [22.5, 0, 0] is fine, a rotation of [22.5, 0, 45] will not
  fully work and only rotate on one axis.

#### **Bones:**

Bones are what Blockbench calls "groups". They serve to group the cubes together, and should be used to group bones
together for animationsBlueprint.

- Bones can go up to ~~112x112x112~~ 106x106x106 (should be 112, not sure why this is) "pixels" (Blockbench units) or
  7x7x7 in-game blocks. *Please note that the size of bones is set by what they have, so if you have cubes that are more
  than 7 blocks apart, you will probably exceed this size limit. Bypassing this limit is as easy as putting the blocks
  in a different boneBlueprint not contained in the first boneBlueprint!*
- Can have any rotation!

Bones are significantly more flexible than cubes, but you should use as few bones as possible! In FMM, due to Minecraft
limitations, each boneBlueprint is a different entity. At a scale, this will affect performance rather quickly! Always
use as few bones as you can, and be mindful of how many of that model you are planning to spawn - the more of it you
plan to have, the fewer bones you should have!

#### **Virtual Bones**

If you are coming from ModelEngine, you probably want to know if/how virtual bones are implemented in FMM. Virtual bones
have been earmarked, but are not currently implemented beyond very basic groundwork.

However, at the very least, the following virtual bones will be compatible with FMM soon:

- Hitboxes / eye height: a boneBlueprint called "hitbox" with a cubeBlueprint that defines the boundaries, and has the same x and z value (the largest value will be picked if they are not the same) defines the hitbox. The eye level is set at the pivot point of the hitbox's boneBlueprint.
- Name tag: a boneBlueprint whose name starts with "tag_". Honestly I would prefer being mode specific here and going with "tag_name" in order to use tags for other things, but that will be seriously considered later.

No other virtual boneBlueprint feature is guaranteed to be added in the immediate future.

## Merging resource packs

While using FMM you will probably need to merge resource packs.

You can merge resource packs manually, but we recommend using an online tool such as [merge.elmakers](https://merge.elmakers.com/) to merge your resource packs.

#### **Safer, easier, uneditable file distribution**

One thing that FMM tries to tackle is users repurposing models they have obtained to edit them in ways the model creator did not want them to edit, specifically in order to reskin or otherwise slightly alter a model and potentially try to resell as an original creation.

To that end, FMM uses the `.fmmodel` file format which aims to strip `.bbmodel` files down to the point where they can
be used by the plugin but can not be edited in Blockbench.

As a modeler, you now have the choice whether you want to release an uneditable `.fmmodel` file, an editable `.bbmodel`
file or even do differential pricing or distribution terms of service for the two.

Generating an `.fmmodel` is as simple as putting your `.bbmodel` in the `~/plugins/FreeMinecraftModels/imports` folder
and reloading the plugin with `/fmm reload` or restarting the server. Your `.fmmodel` will then be in
the `~/plugins/FreeMinecraftModels/models` folder.

## What can FreeMinecraftModels (FMM) do for developers who want to integrate it in their plugins?

FMM has a maven repo!
Maven:

```xml

<repository>
    <id>ossrh-public</id>
    <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/snapshots/</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
<groupId>com.magmaguy</groupId>
<artifactId>FreeMinecraftModels</artifactId>
<version>1.1.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```kotlin
compileOnly group : 'com.magmaguy', name: 'FreeMinecraftModels', version: '1.1.2-SNAPSHOT'
```

*Note FreeMinecraftModels is mean to be used as an API, and will require installation of the plugin on the server. Do
not shade it into your plugin!*

FMM aims to be as easy as possible to use as an API.

Right now, there is only one class you need to know about if you wish to use FMM as an API for your plugin, and that
is `StaticEntity`.

Here is a snippet for handling a static model:

```java
public class FreeMinecraftModelsModel {
    private StaticEntity staticEntity = null;

    //Create the model
    public FreeMinecraftModelsModel(String id, Location location) {
        //This spawns the entity!
        staticEntity = StaticEntity.create(id, location);
        //This checks if the entity spawned correctly
        if (staticEntity == null) Logger.warningMessage("FMM failed to find a model named " + id + " !");
    }

    public void remove() {
        //This removes the entity
        staticEntity.remove();
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that static models are meant to stay in place and act as a decorative element in a fixed location (
animations don't count as 'movement' here). While it is possible to move them, consider whether you might instead want
to use a dynamic model if that is your purpose.

And here is how EliteMobs, my custom bosses plugin, uses dynamic entities:

```java
package com.magmaguy.elitemobs.thirdparty.custommodels.freeminecraftmodels;

import com.magmaguy.elitemobs.mobconstructor.custombosses.CustomBossEntity;
import com.magmaguy.elitemobs.thirdparty.custommodels.CustomModelInterface;
import com.magmaguy.freeminecraftmodels.api.ModeledEntityManager;
import com.magmaguy.freeminecraftmodels.customentity.DynamicEntity;
import lombok.Getter;
import org.bukkit.entity.LivingEntity;

public class CustomModelFMM implements CustomModelInterface {
    @Getter
    private DynamicEntity dynamicEntity;

    public CustomModelFMM(LivingEntity livingEntity, String modelName, String nametagName) {
        dynamicEntity = DynamicEntity.create(modelName, livingEntity);
        if (dynamicEntity == null) return;
        dynamicEntity.setName(nametagName);
    }

    public static void reloadModels() {
        ModeledEntityManager.reload();
    }

    public static boolean modelExists(String modelName) {
        return ModeledEntityManager.modelExists(modelName);
    }

    @Override
    public void shoot() {
        if (dynamicEntity.hasAnimation("attack_ranged")) dynamicEntity.playAnimation("attack_ranged", false);
        else dynamicEntity.playAnimation("attack", false);
    }

    @Override
    public void melee() {
        if (dynamicEntity.hasAnimation("attack_melee")) dynamicEntity.playAnimation("attack_melee", false);
        else dynamicEntity.playAnimation("attack", false);
    }

    @Override
    public void playAnimationByName(String animationName) {
        dynamicEntity.playAnimation(animationName, false);
    }

    @Override
    public void setName(String nametagName, boolean visible) {
        dynamicEntity.setName(nametagName);
        dynamicEntity.setNameVisible(visible);
    }

    @Override
    public void setNameVisible(boolean visible) {
        dynamicEntity.setNameVisible(visible);
    }

    @Override
    public void switchPhase() {
        dynamicEntity.stopCurrentAnimations();
    }
}
```

Dynamic models are built on top of a living entity, which can be provided either when using the create method as in the
example above, or when running the spawn method on a Dynamic entity.

While there is no formal API resource right now, all elements intended for API use are contained within ModeledEntity (
the base class for all entities), StaticEntity, DynamicEntity and ModeledEntityManager. 99% of developers should find
all the methods they need spread across those three classes.

# Contributing to the FreeMinecraftModels (FMM) project as a developer

FMM is distributed under the GPLV3 license and code contributions are welcome. Here are the basic contribution
guidelines:

- Follow the existing naming conventions, maintain the existing level of verbosity and add enough documentation that
  your contribution is easy to understand
- Keep contributions relevant to the scope of the plugin. If you don't know whether it will be relevant, feel free to
  ask ahead of time.
- Be mindful of the performance impact of your code. Some contributions may be turned away if they are either too
  unoptimized or otherwise cause too great of a performance impact.

## General plugin outline

To save you some time, here is a quick breakdown of the logic flow of FMM:

1) Read the `imports` folder
2) Move files from `imports` folder into the `models` folder. If the file is a `.bbmodel`, it gets converted
   to `.fmmodel` in the models folder.
3) Read the files in the `models` folder.
4) Interpret all model structures, creating `Skeleton`s which contain groups of `Bone`s, and these bones contain groups
   of child `Bone`s and `Cube`s. `Cube`s and `Bone`s generate the JSON resource pack data they are each related to. This
   means that `Cube`s generate the JSON specific to cubes and `Bone`s generate the outline and individual boneBlueprint
   files. Note that one boneBlueprint results in one resource pack file. Models are added to a list as they are
   generated.
5) Still in the `Skeleton`, interpret all `Animations` in the model, if any
6) All data has now been initialized, the resource pack was generated in the `outputs` folder and the plugin is ready to
   be used.

## Tricks used in this plugin:

The tricks used here are fairly well-established and standardized, but will be listed nonetheless because they can be counter-intuitive.

Please note that these tricks are all completely invisible to users and model makers; restrictions and workarounds are only listed to help you understand how FMM bypasses various Minecraft limitations.

- All models are scaled up 4x and then the size and pivot point is readjusted in code in order to extend the theoretical maximum size of the model.
- Because resource pack models can only have models go from -16 to +32 in size, models are shifted in the background. This is completely invisible to players.
- Leather horse armor is used to create models with a hue that can be influenced through code (i.e. for damage indications). The horse armor must be set to white to display the correct colors!
- Blockbench uses a specific system of IDs for the textures, but actually reads the textures sequentially from config. IDs are assigned here based on their position in the list of textures, following how Blockbench does it.
- Each boneBlueprint is a different armor stand entity due to Minecraft limitations.
- Leather horse armor is on the head slot of the armor stand
- Armor stands are used for the default static items. //todo: soon I'll have to implement the new alternative display
  system from MC 1.19.4+, it's way more efficient.
- To avoid collisions with other plugins which modify leather horse armor, FMM uses custom model data values starting at
  50,000.

# Contributing to the FreeMinecraftModels (FMM) project in general

FMM is actually crowdfunded by the lovely people over at [https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy](https://www.patreon.com/magmaguy)! All contributions help more than you'd imagine ;)

# Currently planned features:
- Bedrock client RSP generation.
- Server properties-independent RSP management with geyser integration.
- Custom entities (?).
- tag_projectile as meta bones from which projectiles can be shot (can have more than one per model).

# Current weird limitations that need to be fixed:
- If the pivot point (origin) of a boneBlueprint is set to be over 67ish the model starts floating.


The following is the full wiki of the global plugin!

# Getting started

This page helps you understand how to correctly edit a .yml (.yaml) file. All of my plugins use .yml configuration files, which will reset themselves or stop working if you edit them incorrectly.

Below, you will find every configuration entry type and how they should be formatted if you are modifying any values!

# How to edit .yml files

Files are stored in the `.yml` file format and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is the recommended file editing software for configuration work. Of course you can use any other text editor of your choice.

<div id="config_boolean">

# `Boolean`

`Boolean` values are `true` or `false`. This is what they look like:

```yml
value1: true
value2: false
```

`Boolean`s only ever accept either `true` or `false` values. They are usually used to turn specific features on or off.

</div>

<div id="config_string">

# `String`

`String` values are usually just normal text. It is highly recommended that you create `String` values between quotes, following this format:

```yml
value: "String"
```

While this is not always mandatory, it is mandatory for any string that contains color codes, especially if the first character starts with a [color code](#color_codes). ***Color codes follow the in-game color code format*** meaning that `"&aTest`" would result in green text. The availability of colored text varies depending on the configuration setting. Check [this page](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes) for color codes.

</div>

<details>

<summary>Why?</summary>
Configuration strings can accept special characters such as `&`. If these special characters occupy the first character, such as in `value: "&aString"`, if the `String` is not between quotes the value will be wiped and the config option will be reset to its defaults. This is a limitation of the configuration system that Spigot uses.
</details>

<div id="config_serialized_location">

# `Serialized Location`

`Serialized Location` is a specific type of String which looks like this:

```yml
location: world,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0
```

These are used to store and configure locations. It follows this format: `worldName,X,Y,Z,PITCH,YAW`. Pitch and yaw just determine the direction that the player is looking at, and is implemented the same way Minecraft locations are.

</div>

<div id="config_multiplier">

# `Multiplier`

`Multiplier` values multiply plugin values by that number. These values should ***never*** be between quotes. Here's an example:

```yml
damageMultiplier: 1.0
```

In this case, the damage multiplier would be multiplied by 1, meaning that there is no change from the default value. If the `Multiplier` was `2.0`, the value would be multiplied by `2.0`. If it was `0.5`, it would be multiplied by `0.5`. 

For those not good with fractions, multiplying by `0.5` is the same as dividing by 2. `Multiplier` values should always be larger than 0 (`0.0001` is valid) and don't tend to have a higher ceiling.

</div>

<div id="config_integer">

# `Integer`

`Integer` values are just whole numbers. Example:

```yml
value: 10
```

The main thing about `Integer` values they must be whole numbers. This means that `10.1` is not valid.

</div>

<div id="config_double">

# `Double`

`Double`s are irrational numbers. Example:

```yml
value: 10.01
```

`Double`s can also happen to be whole numbers like integers, like `10.0` or even represented as `10`.

</div>

<div id="config_string_list">

# `String List`
`String List`s are lists of `String` values. These tend to be the hardest values to configure, as they require a very specific config format:

```yml
valuesList:
- "value,1"
- "value,2"
- "value,3"
```

Like with `String`s, it is recommended to keep the values between quotes. Each `String List` has its own format, so you'll have to find the specific format the one you're editing requires; however, globally, that is what the overall format should look like.

</div>

<div id="config_map_list">

# `Map List`

'Map List' are lists of 'Map' value. These are only used in elite scripting, and require this configuration format:

```yml
parentMap:
- Map1:
  key: value
- Map2:
  key: value
  keyForList:
    - "value1"
    - "value2"
```

As you can see, Map Lists can contain any kind of format inside them, but if you are using them in scripting you will need to refer to the documentation to see which are the valid keys and values for the different maps.

</div>

<div id="config_color_codes">

# `Color Codes`

You can also assign colors or make text bold using the following modifiers:

| Code        | Color          | Example                                                |

| **&k**      | Random         | &k<div class="magic-text"></div> &fexample.            |


As you can see in the examples, the modifiers follow the regular minecraft syntax except that the § is replaced with a & when used with EliteMobs. You can use this to modify most EliteMobs text such as, mob names, quest text, dungeon names etc.

Take note that when working properly the modifiers themselves will not show in your text. They are only shown here for demonstration purposes.

It is also possible to combine colors and other text modifiers. For example, you can do:

*<div style="color: green;">&a&oTo get green text that is italic.</div>*

If we wanted our custom mob to have a nice fancy colorful name we would do the following:

```yml
name: $normalBossLevel &aScary &dDragon
```

</div>

<div id="config_material">

# `Material`

`Material` values are just Materials that you can find in MineCraft, such as `IRON_CHESTPLATE`. For a list of valid `Material`s see this [page](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html).

```yml
helmet: IRON_HELMET
```

`Material`s are used as values in several settings such as equipment for mobs, loot drops, quest rewards etc.

</div>

<div id="config_filename">

# `Filename`

`Filename` values are just .yml config files that are formatted to be used with MagmaGuy's plugins. These could be anything from items to quests.

```yml
uniqueLootList:
  - filename: magmaguys_toothpick.yml
```

</div>

<div id="config_trimming_worlds">

# Trimming Worlds

Sometimes, you may need to reduce the size of your Minecraft world to make it lighter and, consequently, easier to distribute. This can be achieved through the use of the [WorldBorder plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldborder-1-15.80466/). Despite the plugin being listed as only supporting MineCraft up to version 1.19, it functions seamlessly on the latest MineCraft version as of January 25, 2024.

<details>
<summary>Tip</summary>
If you are doing this for the first time it might be a good idea to create a backup of your world just in case something goes wrong.
</details>

Once the plugin is installed, navigate to the middle of the world or the specific area you wish to trim. Then, execute the command `/wb set x`, where `x` represents the approximate radius size you want for your area.

<details>
<summary>Tip</summary>
If <code>/wb</code> is not working for you, try <code>/worldborder:wb</code>.
</details>

After executing this command, fly to the edges of your world to verify that the world border has been properly set and covers the intended size. You will recognize reaching the world border edge when you are pushed back, accompanied by a message in the chat.

![trim_pic_1.jpg](../../../img/wiki/trim_pic_1.jpg)

In the image above, we aim to trim the world around the purple blocks, leaving only a few chunks around them. To achieve this, we stand in the middle of the purple area on the red squares and execute `/wb set 50`, setting the world border just beyond the purple area.

Next, we use the `/wb trim [freq] [pad]` command, with the frequency set to 200 and the pad to 20. The pad determines how many chunks should be left around the world border (the purple area), and the frequency determines how many chunks should be processed per second. After running `/wb trim 200 20`, we will be prompted to confirm by executing `/wb trim confirm`. We confirm the action, and after some time, our world will be trimmed, reducing its size and making it more convenient for distribution.

You can now remove the world border using `/wb clear all` or just leave it if you wish.

## Trimming the world folder

There are several files and folders located in your world folder that we can discard since the plugins do not use all of them. This will cut down the size of your world and make it easier to distribute.

For a NORMAL world Environment:

To prepare your world, keep the following files and folders:

1. **region** folder
2. **raids.dat** from within the **data** folder (ensure it's placed inside the **data** folder when copying)
3. **level.dat** file

You can safely delete all other files and folders located in the world folder. This will set up your world correctly for the NORMAL environment.

For NETHER and THE_END world Environments:

To prepare your world, keep the following files and folders:

1. **region** folder inside the **DIM-1** folder (ensure it's placed inside the **DIM-1** folder when copying)
2. **raids.dat** from within the **data** folder (ensure it's placed inside the **data** folder when copying)
3. **level.dat** file

You can safely delete all other files and folders located in the world folder. This will set up your world correctly for the NETHER and THE_END environments.



The following is the full wiki of the resurrectionchest plugin!

What is ResurrectionChest?

<p>
<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgpSsu9NoXA?si=Vy9Hb9BoZxNhjnmj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

Video explanation

ResurrectionChest is a very simple DeathChest plugin. Players set up a death-chest using a chest and a sign at some location ahead of time, and when they die the items they would've dropped get transferred to the chest instead. 

If the chest is full, the items are lost. It is compatible with double chests and hoppers.



How do players setup a ResurrectionChest?

<p>
<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unMSW2WL2AE?si=9uqtEM9u0MlEUvkC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
Video guide.

Place down a chest (can even be a double chest. For this first version, only normal chests work, not shulker boxes or trapped chests)
While sneaking, place a sign on the chest
Write: [deathchest] (works on the first couple of lines of the sign)
That's it!




How do you install this plugin?

Just drag and drop the ResurrectionChest.jar file into your plugins folder! It has no dependencies.

Permissions and commands:
There is only one permission: resurrectionchest.use . It is true by default, so you'll have to add a negative permission to disable it for a group or player (-resurrectionchest.use). There are no commands.

Is this compatible with X world / chest protection system?

This plugin was designed to avoid as many plugin conflicts as possible. All it does is add thing to a chest if the player has set that chest up properly. It should not have any conflicts with most protection systems, and death chests should be get protected by other plugins with no issues whatsoever.

How much can I configure / customize this?

This is an early release of the plugin, if there is enough interest I will add more customization options.
